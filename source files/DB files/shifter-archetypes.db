When activating this ability, the shifter must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types from the table below. Her draconic aspect abilities grant resistances and deal a type of damage based on the chosen dragon type. While shifted into this form, she gains the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Scent\">scent</a> ability and energy resistance 5 against the energy type that corresponds to her selected dragon type. She can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The shifter can select a different dragon type every time she uses this ability, but she must end her current draconic aspect and activate this ability again in order to change her chosen dragon type. <br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Dragon Type</td>\n<td>Energy Type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>Electricity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Red</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>White</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bronze</td>\n<td>Electricity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gold</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br /><br />At 5th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter&rsquo;s draconic aspect increases to 10. At 10th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter&rsquo;s draconic aspect increases to 15, and she gains a <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Breath%20Weapon\">breath weapon</a> of her energy type that deals 1d6 points of damage per shifter level within a 30-foot cone. A target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the dragonblood shifter&rsquo;s level + her Charisma modifier) to reduce damage by half. The dragonblood shifter can use her breath weapon once per day.<br /><br />At 15th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter&rsquo;s draconic aspect increases to 20, and she can use her breath weapon twice per day.<br /><br />At 20th level, the dragonblood shifter becomes immune to the energy type that corresponds to her selected dragon type while in her draconic aspect. In addition, she gains spell resistance equal to 10 + her shifter level, and she can use her breath weapon three times per day.<br /><br />This replaces shifter aspect and all improvements to shifter aspect.<br /><br />Wyrmshifter (Su): At 9th level, a dragonblood shifter can push her form closer to that of a true dragon. She gains a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against sleep and paralysis effects. She does not gain the wild shape ability until 9th level. When using the ability, she takes on the form of a true dragon; this ability functions as <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=form%20of%20the%20dragon%20I\">form of the dragon I</a> instead of <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=beast%20shape%20II\">beast shape II</a>. A dragonblood shifter can use wild shape for a number of minutes each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. This duration doesn&rsquo;t need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. For abilities that function based on uses of wild shape, each minute of wild shape counts as a use.<br /><br />This alters wild shape and replaces chimeric aspect.<br /><br />Improved Wyrmshifter (Su): At 14th level, a dragonblood shifter&rsquo;s ties to her draconic abilities grow stronger. Her bonus on saves against sleep and paralysis effects increases to +4. Her wild shape ability now functions as <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=form%20of%20the%20dragon%20II\">form of the dragon II</a>, and she can use it for a number of minutes each day equal to twice her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier, though it still must be used in 1-minute increments.<br /><br />This replaces greater chimeric aspect.<br /><br />Greater Wyrmshifter (Su): At 20th level, a dragonblood shifter&rsquo;s tie to her draconic abilities reaches its peak. She becomes immune to sleep and paralysis effects. She can use wild shape to transform into a dragon for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments. For abilities that function based on uses of wild shape, each hour of wild shape counts as a use.<br /><br />This replaces final aspect.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Alternate Natural Attacks</h2>\n<p>A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter&rsquo;s claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter&rsquo;s claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter&rsquo;s claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter&rsquo;s natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.<br /><br />Dragon (Dragonblood Shifter Archetype): Bite (B, P, S), tail slap (B), wing (B).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shifter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_34.jpg","_id":"0APft9CFWeMnLM60"}

Fiendflesh shifters care nothing for the natural world and are instead consumed by an ever-growing lust for power at any price. To other shifters, the fiendflesh shifter is often viewed as a monster herself&mdash;an intrusion into the natural order of things and a foe who must be sought out and destroyed. Very few druids will ever willingly ally with fiendflesh shifters; this leaves these outcasts to live bitter, lonely lives or to seek out fiendish cults or other abhorrent faiths for support and companionship.<br /><br />Alignment: A fiendflesh shifter must be evil in alignment. If the fiendflesh shifter becomes nonevil, she loses all powers granted by this archetype.<br /><br />This alters the shifter&rsquo;s alignment.<br /><br />Infernal Claws (Ex): A fiendflesh shifter&rsquo;s claws are infused with the unholy power of the evil Outer Planes. At 1st level, a fiendflesh shifter&rsquo;s claws are treated as evil weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This ability otherwise functions as the shifter claws class feature.<br /><br />This alters shifter claws.<br /><br />Fiendish Aspect (Su): At 1st level, a fiendflesh shifter can temporarily transform her body into an amalgam of otherworldly evil creatures as a swift action. While in this form, the fiendflesh shifter gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet (or doubles the range of her darkvision if she already has it), a gore natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 points of damage if the shifter is Small), and DR 1/good. A fiendflesh shifter can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments.<br /><br />At 5th level, the fiendflesh shifter&rsquo;s DR increases to 2/ good and she also grows a pair of bat-like wings when in her fiendish aspect, granting her a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability.<br /><br />At 10th level, the fiendflesh shifter&rsquo;s DR increases to 5/good, and the electricity and fire resistance provided by her fiendish resilience ability (see below) doubles while she&rsquo;s in her fiendish aspect.<br /><br />At 15th level, the fiendflesh shifter&rsquo;s DR increases to 7/good and her fly speed increases to 60 feet.<br /><br />At 20th level, the fiendflesh shifter&rsquo;s DR increases to 10/good. She also gains immunity to electricity and fire and spell resistance equal to 15 + her shifter level.<br /><br />This replaces wild shape, shifter aspect, and all improvements to shifter aspect.<br /><br />Fiendish Resilience (Su): At 2nd level, a fiendflesh shifter gains a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC and resistance 5 to electricity and fire, but only while unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light or medium nonmetal armor. At 4th level, 12th level, and 20th level, this natural armor bonus increases by 1. At 8th level and 16th level, the fiendflesh shifter&rsquo;s resistance to electricity and fire increases by 5.<br /><br />This replaces defensive instinct.<br /><br />Chimeric Fiend (Su): At 9th level, when a fiendflesh shifter uses her fiendish aspect ability, she can gain an additional ability from the list below. The fiendflesh shifter can change which ability she gains each time she uses fiendish aspect.<br /><br />Daemon: Acid resistance 10 and a +4 profane bonus on saves against disease.<br /><br />Demon: The shifter&rsquo;s electricity resistance doubles.<br /><br />Devil: The shifter&rsquo;s fire resistance doubles.<br /><br />This replaces chimeric aspect.<br /><br />Greater Chimeric Fiend (Su): At 14th level, a fiendflesh shifter&rsquo;s chimeric fiend ability grants her additional bonuses as noted below.<br /><br />Daemon: The shifter gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Constitution score and immunity to disease.<br /><br />Demon: The shifter gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Strength score and increases the damage die of all natural attacks by one step.<br /><br />Devil: The shifter gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Dexterity score and see in darkness as per the universal monster rule.<br /><br />This replaces greater chimeric aspect.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shifter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_34.jpg","_id":"15fhjrAZl8LQTTRB"}
{"name":"Shifter (Elementalist Shifter)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 78</a><br />Rather than drawing power from bestial aspects, elementalist shifters channel power from the Inner Sphere and can take on powerful elemental forms at the cost of the greater diversity available to traditional shifters. Although the elementalist shifter&rsquo;s powers seem more outlandish and supernatural than those of others of their kind, they remain equally immersed in the druidic traditions; their focus is simply rooted in expressions of nature found in extraplanar regions: the planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.<br /><br />Languages: An elementalist shifter adds Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran to her list of available bonus languages.<br /><br />This alters the shifter&rsquo;s languages.<br /><br />Elemental Aspect (Su): At 1st level, an elementalist shifter chooses one elemental aspect (see page 79) rather than a shifter aspect. This ability otherwise functions as shifter aspect. As the elementalist shifter gains levels, she gains more elemental aspects: a second aspect at 5th level, a third at 10th, and a fourth at 15th.<br /><br />This alters shifter aspect.<br /><br />Elemental Speech (Su): When in her elemental aspect, an elementalist shifter gains the benefit of tongues with creatures of the elemental subtype that matches her elemental aspect.<br /><br />This replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Elemental Strike (Su): At 1st level, as a swift action, an elementalist shifter can charge her melee attacks with elemental energy. The elementalist shifter can charge her attacks only with an element she has chosen with elemental aspect. Once charged, each melee attack the elementalist shifter makes until the start of her next turn deals an additional 1d6 points of energy damage based on the element she chooses when taking this action (see Elemental Aspects on page 79). This additional damage increases by 1d6 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 6d6 points of energy damage at 20th level. An elementalist shifter can&rsquo;t use elemental strike while under a polymorph effect.<br /><br />This replaces shifter claws.<br /><br />Elemental Form (Su): At 4th level, when an elementalist shifter uses wild shape, she is instead affected as if by elemental body I, but she gains only the benefits listed in her elemental aspect. While in an elemental form, the elementalist shifter can speak only the elemental language associated with that form, and she can do so only if she knows it.<br /><br />This alters wild shape.<br /><br />Omnielementalist (Su): At 9th level, an elementalist shifter can fuse two elemental forms together, gaining combined powers of the different aspects and manifesting them in ways that bring to mind powerful natural weather phenomena. When the elementalist shifter takes on one minor form each from two of her elemental aspects, she gains an additional ability as long as she maintains the form. The effects of the abilities depend on the elemental combination, as detailed below.<br /><br />Ash Storm (Su): By combining air and fire, the elementalist shifter surrounds herself with a storm of swirling ash, granting her a 20% miss chance against ranged attacks.<br /><br />Downpour (Su): The elementalist shifter combines the powers of air and water to generate a torrential downpour in her square and squares adjacent to her. This rain automatically extinguishes all nonmagical fires in her square and squares adjacent to her (including flames on creatures that have caught on fire). It also has a chance to extinguish ongoing magical fire (but not instantaneous magical fire effects such as fireball) within or that enters the area, as if the elementalist shifter had cast dispel magic, using her elementalist shifter level as her caster level for the effect.<br /><br />Mudslide (Su): Combining the elements of earth and water causes the elementalist shifter to generate an aura of mud. This mud extends out to all squares adjacent to her and counts as difficult terrain; it moves with her and vanishes when she ends her elemental aspect.<br /><br />Sandstorm (Su): Combining the high winds of air and fine particulates of earth produces a sandstorm that extends out to a radius of 20 feet from the elementalist shifter. All light levels in the area diminish by one step, and creatures caught in the effect take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round they remain within the sandstorm.<br /><br />Steam Cloud (Su) When the elementalist shifter enters a minor form of fire and water at the same time, the heat of fire and moisture of water generate an explosive area of steam around her out to a radius of 20 feet as per obscuring mist. The mist remains in place until she ends her elemental aspect; it doesn&rsquo;t move with her.<br /><br />Volcanic Stride (Su): By combining earth and fire, the elementalist shifter can damage the ground around herself. As a standard action, she can deform a region of natural or artificial rock in her space, turning it into difficult terrain and causing creatures that pass through it to take an amount of fire damage equal to that dealt by her elemental strike with no save. Affected terrain remains transformed until the shifter ends her elemental aspect.<br /><br />This replaces chimeric aspect and greater chimeric aspect.<br /><br /></p>\n<h1>Elemental Aspects (Elementalist Shifter Aspects)</h1>\n<p>Elementalist shifters do not infuse their bodies with bestial qualities taken from animal aspects. Rather, they take into themselves raw elemental power from the planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The following aspects are used by the elementalist shifter archetype; they cannot be selected as aspects by other shifters.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Air</h2>\n<p>You take on the power of an air elemental, gaining the ability to fly and to control powerful gusts of wind. You take inspiration from the patterns of clouds in the sky, the tumultuous fury of the storm, and the gentle caress of a cooling breeze. Flying creatures, such as bats and birds, are your favorites. Spring is your favored season&mdash;a time when storms bring freshness to the world but that lacks the brutality of winter&rsquo;s devastation.<br /><br />Minor Form: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Major Form: Your shape changes to that of a Medium air elemental (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 120). While you are in this form, you gain a fly speed of 60 feet (average maneuverability) and airborne creatures take a &ndash;1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against you. At 8th level, your fly speed increases to 100 feet (perfect) and you gain the whirlwind special ability (see below). At 15th level, you gain Improved Natural Attack with your slam.<br /><br />Whirlwind (Su): You can transform yourself into a whirlwind as a standard action for 1 round per 2 shifter levels you have. This otherwise functions as per the whirlwind universal monster rule.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Earth</h2>\n<p>You take on the power of an earth elemental, gaining the ability to burrow through the earth and deliver powerful blows. You take comfort in caverns, mountainous regions, and areas rent by canyons and chasms, and you feel a deep kinship to burrowing animals of all types. Be it the soothing feel of fresh topsoil or the devastating fury of an earthquake, you understand the raw power of earth. Your favored season is fall&mdash;the traditional time of the harvest, when bounty from the earth is offered.<br /><br />Minor Form: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Constitution score. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Major Form: Your shape changes to that of a Medium earth elemental (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 122). While you are in this form, your base speed is reduced to 20 feet, but you gain a burrow speed of 10 feet, and you gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both you and your target are touching the ground. If the target is airborne or waterborne, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on attack and damage rolls against it. These modifiers also apply to bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers, whether you are initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. At 8th level, your burrow speed increases to 20 feet and you gain earth glide as per the universal monster rule. At 15th level, you gain Improved Natural Attack with your slam.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Fire</h2>\n<p>You take on the power of a fire elemental, becoming a being of living flame that can burn enemies and move with great speed. You enjoy regions where precipitation rarely intrudes, such as desert landscapes and dry savannas, but the slopes of volcanoes hold the greatest majesty to you. You enjoy the companionship of swiftly moving creatures and those who enjoy basking in the sun, for you empathize with their appreciation of the daytime&rsquo;s warmth. Forest fires are things of beauty to you, yet you respect fire and would never think to wantonly inflict it upon the natural world. Summer is your favorite season, for this is a time of heat waves and blistering sunny days.<br /><br />Minor Form: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Major Form: Your shape changes to that of a Medium fire elemental (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 124). While you are in this form, your base speed changes to 50 feet and you gain immunity to fire, vulnerability to cold, and the burn special attack as per the universal monster rule, dealing damage equal to your slam attack whenever a creature fails its Reflex save against that ability. At 8th level, you gain Improved Natural Attack with your slam. At 15th level, you deal fire damage equal to double your slam damage against opponents that fail their saves against your burn ability.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Water</h2>\n<p>You take on the power of a water elemental, gaining the ability to move swiftly in water, rain down crashing blows on your enemies, and transform into a swirling vortex. You identify with aquatic animals of all types, be they water-breathing creatures such as fish, amphibians such as newts or frogs, or air-breathing mammals such as whales or walruses. The unrelenting churn of waves on the shoreline, the soothing babble of a gentle stream, and the pounding kiss of a deluge of rain all bring joy to your heart. Your favored season is winter, for it is at this time that the most powerful of storms bring water to all the world.<br /><br />Minor Form: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Strength score. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level.<br /><br />Major Form: Your shape changes to that of a Medium water elemental (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 126). While you are in this form, your base speed is reduced to 20 feet but you gain a swim speed of 60 feet, and if both you and your target are touching water, you also gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. If the target is touching the ground, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on attack and damage rolls against it. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers, whether you are initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. At 8th level, your swim speed increases to 90 feet, your touch automatically extinguishes nonmagical flames of size Large or smaller, and you can dispel magical fires as per dispel magic using your shifter level as your effective caster level. At 15th level, you gain Improved Natural Attack with your slam and the vortex special ability, which functions identically to the air aspect&rsquo;s whirlwind ability (see page 79) but can form only underwater and cannot leave the water.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shifter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_34.jpg","_id":"2NuGqvi4iY3Eu2DD"}

A weretouched also counts as being in her natural form for the purpose of determining whether she can extend her shifter claws. A weretouched&rsquo;s hybrid form is roughly the same size and shape as her natural form, albeit with bestial qualities such as digitigrade legs or shaggy fur, so her equipment does not merge into her new form when she shifts between her natural form and hybrid form. In addition, the size of a weretouched&rsquo;s hybrid form is the same as the size of her natural form. This otherwise counts as assuming a major form using wild shape.<br /><br />This alters wild shape.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shifter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_34.jpg","_id":"8Hzt4osdJ6TNhYCU"}

Holy beast shifters pledge to hunt down their deity&rsquo;s enemies to earn that deity&rsquo;s blessing. These shifters tend to take on the aspect of their deity&rsquo;s sacred animal, and many of them seek to destroy rakshasas.<br /><br />Beast&rsquo;s Blessing: A holy beast must worship a deity.<br /><br />Blessed Claws (Su): This ability functions as the shifter&rsquo;s claws class feature, except the holy beast shifter&rsquo;s default claws are long and thin, dealing piercing damage. At 3rd level, her claws are treated as one type of aligned weapon (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) within one step of her deity&rsquo;s alignment in addition to ignoring DR/cold iron, DR/magic, and DR/silver.

This grants her a touch attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and counts as an area attack for the purpose of overcoming the damage reduction of swarms. She doesn&rsquo;t add her Strength modifier as a bonus on damage rolls for this attack. This damage increases by 1d6 at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter (maximum 6d6 points of damage at 20th level).

The verdant shifter is treated as both her normal creature type and a plant creature for purposes of spells or effects that target a creature by type (such as bane weapons and a ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy).

Known as oozemorphs, these shifters focus on the ooze&mdash;a form of life as simple in construction as it is dangerous in combat. While some shifters consider the oozemorph to be unsettling or even vile, these shifters merely embrace a stranger form of life than most. They are not inherently evil, yet they are often misunderstood by druidic circles and these circles&rsquo; shifter champions.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An oozemorph is proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. <br /><br />This replaces a shifter&rsquo;s normal weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Compression (Ex): An oozemorph gains compression as per the universal monster rule. This ability can be used regardless of the current form the oozemorph has taken.<br /><br />Fluidic Body (Su): An oozemorph&rsquo;s base form is not that of her race but rather that of a protoplasmic blob that has the same volume and weight. An oozemorph treats her creature type as both ooze and her base creature type from her race for the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as bane weapons and a ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy). In this form, the oozemorph is immune to critical hits and precision damage and can&rsquo;t be flanked. However, she has no magic item slots and she cannot benefit from armor; cast spells; hold objects; speak; or use any magic item that requires activation, is held, or is worn on the body.<br /><br />An oozemorph reverts to this formless state whenever she is unconscious or in an area of antimagic. This is treated as a polymorph effect.<br /><br />A number of times per day equal to half her level (minimum 1), an oozemorph can assume a humanoid form as a move action. This transformation is identical to alter self, except the oozemorph can maintain the form for a number of hours equal to her level. Each hour after this duration, the oozemorph must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or revert back to her fluidic body until she rests for at least 8 hours. This save DC increases by 1 for each additional hour spent maintaining the form.<br /><br />At 8th level, the oozemorph can treat this ability as beast shape I, and at 15th level, she can treat this ability as beast shape II or giant shape I.<br /><br />Ending this transformation at any time reverts the oozemorph back to her ooze form and renders her fatigued for a number of minutes equal to the number of hours she maintained the form.<br /><br />This replaces chimeric form, greater chimeric form, wild shape, shifter aspect, and all improvements of shifter aspect.<br /><br />Morphic Weaponry (Ex): An oozemorph can create a number of natural weapons to fight with from any portion of her body, regardless of her current form. At 1st level, as a move action, an oozemorph can form two primary natural attacks that each deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen by the oozemorph when she forms them. An oozemorph can change the damage type of any number of her natural weapons as a swift action. An oozemorph gains one additional primary natural attack at 6th level and another at 15th level.<br /><br />The total number of natural attacks an oozemorph has at any given time includes those gained via her current form. For example, an 8th-level oozemorph who has taken the form of a wolf with beast shape I has a bite attack as part of that form; she can create only two additional natural attacks via morphic weaponry, for a total of three attacks available to her at that level. If the oozemorph later reverts to a humanoid form with no natural weapons, she can instead create three morphic weapons.<br /><br />This replaces shifter claws.<br /><br />Ooze Empathy (Ex): An oozemorph gains the shifter&rsquo;s wild empathy class feature, but she can use it only to influence the attitude of oozes with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. An oozemorph can use this ability on mindless oozes; when she does so, she imparts a modicum of intellect to the ooze to allow it to respond to her commands.<br /><br />This alters wild empathy.<br /><br />Damage Reduction (Ex): At 2nd level, an oozemorph gains DR 4/slashing while unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light nonmetal armor. This damage reduction increases by 2 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of DR 14/slashing at 20th level.<br /><br />This replaces defensive instinct.<br /><br />Clinging Ooze (Ex): At 4th level, when in her natural form, an oozemorph gains a climb speed of 10 feet.<br /><br />This replaces woodland stride.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Nethys Note</h2>\n<p>The oozemorph archetype has had several of its abilities clarified in the <a href=\"http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1hj\">official Paizo FAQ</a> and have been copied below:<br /><br />Oozemorph Shifter: How does the oozemorph&rsquo;s fluidic body work? Can the oozemorph actually move at all in ooze form? Why does a supernatural ability still have an effect in an antimagic field?<br /><br />Fluidic Body is essentially two effects in one. The first, which is a permanent part of your character once you become an oozemorph, is that your base form is now an ooze shape. Even if you lose fluidic body for some reason (antimagic field, violating your code of conduct, etc) your base form is still the amorphous oozelike form. The other half of the ability is a supernatural polymorph effect to transform into humanoid (and later bestial) forms. <br /><br />Despite having an oozelike shape, an oozemorph&rsquo;s base form is not an ooze, though it does also count as an ooze for the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type. The oozelike form doesn&rsquo;t gain any abilities of the ooze creature type except as stated by the archetype itself. This form retains the base senses and land speed of the oozemorph&rsquo;s original race, as well as racial abilities like dwarfs&rsquo; greed or gnomes&rsquo; obsession that don&rsquo;t depend on shape, but it loses abilities dependent on form, including form-based speeds like strix&rsquo;s flight (and most other racial speeds beyond land speed), racial natural attacks like catfolks&rsquo; claws, and other abilities like tieflings&rsquo; prehensile tail. However, if the oozemorph possesses a racial ability denied her in her oozelike form and transforms into a member of her own race with fluidic body, she gains the full benefits of that racial ability for that duration, even if it isn&rsquo;t usually granted when using alter self (or the appropriate spell for a non-humanoid oozemorph). An oozemorph's compression, damage reduction, and morphic weaponry function in its oozelike form and any form it takes via fluidic body, though not in forms it takes via other polymorph effects.<br /><br />These clarifications will be reflected in the next errata.<br /><br />Oozemorph and Items: I know I don&rsquo;t have any item slots as an ooze, but what about items that take 24 hours to attune? Can I just never use those items?<br /><br />An oozemorph can carry items floating in its mass that are considered to be attuned. When it turns into a humanoid form via fluidic body, it can equip any number of those items (even armor, which usually takes time to don), leaving the rest on the ground in its space. If it turns into a animal via fluidic form, the items meld into the new form and grant some passive benefits, as normal for polymorph effects</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shifter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_34.jpg","_id":"Tnb5eGgeGKRGFsZM"}

This natural attack otherwise deals damage as the shifter&rsquo;s claws.<br /><br />This alters shifter claws.<br /><br />Reactive Aspect (Su): An adaptive shifter gains the ability to change parts of her body to avoid harm, gain a physical advantage, or overcome an obstacle. She can do so a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier + her shifter level. By activating this ability, either as an immediate action or as a swift action, an adaptive shifter gains the benefits of one of her reactive forms until the beginning of her next turn (see below). An adaptive shifter can assume only one reactive form at a time. Activating a new reactive form (or forms) ends all reactive forms currently manifested.<br /><br />At 9th level, an adaptive shifter gains the benefits of up to two reactive forms whenever she uses this ability. At 14th level, she can assume up to three forms. At 20th level, she learns all reactive forms and doubles her effective Wisdom modifier for the purpose of calculating her uses of reactive aspect per day.<br /><br />This replaces shifter aspect, chimeric aspect, greater chimeric aspect, and final aspect.<br /><br />Reactive Form (Su): An adaptive shifter learns two reactive forms from the list below. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an adaptive shifter learns an additional reactive form. Forms marked with an asterisk (*) are lasting forms. An adaptive shifter can spend two uses of reactive aspect to increase a lasting form&rsquo;s duration to 1 minute. Forms not marked with an asterisk always last only until the beginning of her next turn.<br /><br />Adaptive Defense: When assuming this form, the adaptive shifter chooses one saving throw and gains a competence bonus on the selected save equal to her Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />Aligned Adaptation*: When assuming this form, the adaptive shifter chooses one alignment within one step of her own alignment on either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis. All spells, effects, and magic items affect the adaptive shifter as though that were her actual alignment. If she is at least 10th level, her natural weapon attacks overcome damage reduction as if they were weapons of her assumed alignment.<br /><br />Aquatic Form*: The adaptive shifter gains a swim speed equal to her base speed, and she can breathe underwater.<br /><br />Climbing Form*: The adaptive shifter gains a climb speed equal to her base speed.<br /><br />Durable Form: The adaptive shifter gains DR 5/ adamantine. This damage reduction increases by 1 for every 2 levels she has beyond 8th. She must be at least 8th level to select this form.<br /><br />Evasive Form*: The adaptive shifter gains compression (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 295), a +4 dodge bonus to her CMD against grapple combat maneuvers, and a competence bonus equal to her Wisdom modifier on Escape Artist checks.<br /><br />Giant Form*: The adaptive shifter increases in size, as per enlarge person. The adaptive shifter can assume this form only as a swift action.<br /><br />Resistant Form*: When assuming this form, the adaptive shifter chooses acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. She gains resistance to the chosen damage type equal to 5 plus half her level. She can learn this form a second time, increasing the resistance granted to 10 plus her level.<br /><br />Restoring Form: The adaptive shifter regains 1d8 hit points. For every 4 levels she has, the number of hit points she regains increases by 1d8. The adaptive shifter can assume this form only as a swift action.<br /><br />Scouting Form*: The adaptive shifter gains a competence bonus equal to her Wisdom modifier on Stealth checks, and she gains the benefits of the shifter&rsquo;s trackless step ability. At 12th level, she can use Stealth to hide, even if she does not have cover or concealment (but not if observed).<br /><br />Sensory Form*: The adaptive shifter gains low-light vision and scent. She can learn this form a second time to also gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a competence bonus on Perception checks equal to her Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />Sky Hunter Form*: The adaptive shifter gains a fly speed equal to her base speed with average maneuverability. She must be at least 6th level to select this form. She can learn this form a second time, increasing her fly speed by 20 feet and improving her maneuverability to good.<br /><br />Spiked Form*: The adaptive shifter grows spines over her body. Any foe striking her with an unarmed strike or a melee natural weapon takes an amount of piercing damage equal to the base damage of her shifter claws, which ignores any damage reduction her shifter claws would ignore. She can learn this form a second time, allowing her to fling her spines as thrown natural weapons that deal piercing damage, have a range increment of 30 feet, and allow her to make multiple attacks with her spines as part of a full attack; these otherwise deal damage and overcome damage reduction as her shifter claws.<br /><br />Sprinting Form*: The adaptive shifter&rsquo;s base speed increases by 20 feet.<br /><br />Stretching Form: The adaptive shifter&rsquo;s reach with natural weapons increases by 5 feet.<br /><br />Lasting Adaptation (Su): At 5th level, an adaptive shifter can spend 1 minute willing her body to adapt in a more enduring way. At the end of the minute, she expends two uses of her reactive aspect and selects one lasting form she knows. She assumes this form and can maintain it until she regains her daily uses of reactive aspect or uses this ability again. This adaptation does not count against the maximum number of forms she can assume at once. She can select a form that has a minimum level only if her character level is at least 3 higher than the minimum level.<br /><br />At 15th level, the adaptive shifter can maintain up to two lasting adaptations simultaneously, spending an additional minute and two uses of her reactive aspect each time she assumes a new adaptation.<br /><br />This replaces wild empathy, track, woodland stride, and trackless step.<br /><br />Unfettered Wild Shape (Su): At 6th level, an adaptive shifter gains the ability to turn into other creatures. This functions as a druid&rsquo;s wild shape ability, except she does not gain the ability to turn into an elemental. The shifter&rsquo;s effective druid level is equal to her class level. She can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to half her effective druid level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-hour increments. For abilities that function based on &ldquo;uses of wild shape,&rdquo; each hour of unfettered wild shape counts as a use.<br /><br />This replaces wild shape.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shifter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_34.jpg","_id":"bXWEDLYx9P2GrqEF"}

The rageshaper is a destructive force of nature brought to bear&mdash;a wild and uncontrollable engine of annihilation fueled by wrath. Rageshapers fly into bloodletting frenzies and rain down devastation like unstoppable natural disasters.<br /><br />Alignment: A rageshaper can be any nonlawful alignment. A rageshaper who becomes lawful cannot take any further levels in rageshaper, but he does not lose access to any rageshaper abilities he has already gained.<br /><br />This alters the shifter&rsquo;s alignment.<br /><br />Devastating Form (Su): A rageshaper can enter a state of intense fury, transforming into a living engine of destruction. This ability functions as the barbarian&rsquo;s rage class feature, except entering this state of fury requires a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and has additional effects as noted below. At the start of the rageshaper&rsquo;s next turn, he not only gains the benefit of rage but also grows one size category larger (though worn equipment and held items do not increase in size).<br /><br />Armor or clothing the rageshaper wears that doesn&rsquo;t accommodate his changing size immediately gains the broken condition. If insufficient room is available to accommodate this change, the rageshaper attains the maximum possible size for the available space and can attempt a Strength check (using his increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If the check fails, he is constrained but not harmed by the materials enclosing him.<br /><br />A rageshaper can remain in his devastating form for a number of rounds per day equal to his shifter level. He can dismiss devastating form only with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + his shifter level) made as a free action. On a failed save, the attempted remains in devastating form for an additional round. If the rageshaper does not successfully end his devastating form before he runs out of daily rounds, the next time he fails his Will save to revert, he flies into an uncontrollable frenzy as if affected by confusion, but he treats a roll of 26&ndash;50 as &ldquo;attacks nearest creature.&rdquo; Each round the rageshaper spends in an uncontrollable frenzy, the Will save DC to exit devastating form decreases by 2.<br /><br />When a rageshaper ends his devastating form ability, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds he spent in devastating form. A rageshaper cannot enter devastating form again while fatigued or exhausted. If a rageshaper falls unconscious, his devastating form ends immediately.<br /><br />At 10th level, the rageshaper can grow up to a maximum of two size categories larger with devastating form and his rage is now treated as greater rage.<br /><br />At 20th level, the rageshaper can grow up to a maximum of three size categories larger with devastating form and his rage is treated as mighty rage.<br /><br />This replaces wild shape, shifter aspect, and all improvements to shifter aspect.<br /><br />Terrible Slam (Su): A rageshaper can deliver blows that demolish his foes. This functions as the shifter claws class ability, except his natural weapons are treated as slam attacks. Additionally, rather than granting the ability to bypass different kinds of damage reduction, the rageshaper&rsquo;s terrible slam ignores some of an object&rsquo;s hardness. At 1st level, terrible slam ignores 5 points of an object&rsquo;s hardness. This increases to 10 points at 5th level, 15 points at 10th level, and 20 points at 15th level.<br /><br />This alters shifter claws.<br /><br />Invulnerable Defenses (Ex): At 2nd level, a rageshaper becomes difficult to harm in his devastating form. Whenever the rageshaper takes on his devastating form and is unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light or medium nonmetal armor, he gains a +2 natural armor bonus to his AC and DR 2/&mdash;.<br /><br />This replaces defensive instinct, chimeric aspect, and greater chimeric aspect.<br /><br />Unrestrained Stride (Ex): At 3rd level, whenever the rageshaper is in devastating form, he ignores movement penalties from difficult terrain and is immune to the entangled condition.<br /><br />This replaces woodland stride.<br /><br />Terrible Leap (Ex): At 5th level, when a rageshaper is in his devastating form, he can perform a terrible leap as a move action without attempting an Acrobatics check, jumping any distance up to his move speed (upward movement counts as double, as when flying). He can leap in this way once per day per shifter level.<br /><br />This replaces trackless step.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shifter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_34.jpg","_id":"l7zpD6qYIOlpbg7t"}

These style shifters have honed their techniques and shared them with the rest of Golarion.<br /><br />Armor Proficiency: A style shifter is not proficient with medium armor or shields.<br /><br />This alters the shifter&rsquo;s armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Natural Strikes (Ex): A style shifter is considered to have <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike\">Improved Unarmed Strike</a> for the purposes of feat prerequisites and can apply the effects of feats that have <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike\">Improved Unarmed Strike</a> as a prerequisite to her shifter claws.<br /><br />This alters shifter claws.<br /><br />Style Shifting (Ex): A style shifter gains access to style aspects. A style aspect provides benefits only while the style shifter is in the style feat stance associated with the appropriate aspect (such as <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Boar%20Style\">Boar Style</a> with Form of the Boar). He can shift into his style aspect for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + his shifter level. The duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. A style shifter can shift into a style aspect as a free action as part of entering a style feat&rsquo;s stance. Otherwise, shifting into a style aspect is a swift action, while ending the effect is a free action that can be taken only on the style shifter&rsquo;s turn. He can shift between any aspects he has during the duration without additional cost.<br /><br />This replaces shifter aspect, chimeric aspect, greater chimeric aspect, and final aspect.<br /><br />Style Mastery (Ex): At 1st level, 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, a style shifter gains a bonus <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Style\">style feat</a>. He does not need to meet the prerequisites of the feat. Starting at 5th level, he can choose to instead gain a wildcard style slot. Whenever he enters one or more styles, he can spend his wildcard style slots to gain feats in those styles&rsquo; feat paths (such as <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Panther%20Claw\">Panther Claw</a> if he enters <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Panther%20Style\">Panther Style</a>) as long as he meets their prerequisites. Each time he changes styles, he can also change these wildcard style slots.<br /><br />Form of the Wild (Su): At 6th level, a style shifter gains the ability to turn into other creatures. This functions as a <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Druid\">druid&rsquo;s wild shape ability</a>, except he does not gain the ability to turn into an elemental. The shifter&rsquo;s effective druid level is equal to his class level. He can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to 1/3 his effective druid level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-hour increments. For abilities that function based on uses of wild shape, each hour of form of the wild counts as a use.<br /><br />This alters wild shape.<br /><br />Style Aspects: A style shifter has access to the following style aspects. <br /><br />Form of the Boar: Once per round when you hit a single foe with two or more unarmed strikes, you can tear flesh. When you do, you deal an additional 1 point of bleed damage with the attack. At 8th level, when you tear flesh, the target becomes sickened for 1 round. At 15th level, whenever you confirm a critical hit, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a target within 30 feet as an immediate action. <br /><br />Form of the Crane: You reduce the penalty on attack rolls for <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Attack&amp;Category=Standard%20ACtions\">fighting defensively</a> by 1, to a minimum penalty of 0. At 8th level, when an attack misses you, you can move 5 feet as an immediate action without provoking attacks of opportunity. At 15th level, when an attack misses you, you can move up to half your speed as an immediate action without provoking attacks of opportunity. <br /><br />Form of the Dragon: You gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC for each ally you charge through when charging, up to a total equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum +0). At 8th level, your unarmed strike&rsquo;s damage die increases by one step against shaken targets. At 15th level, whenever you confirm a critical hit against a shaken target, the target becomes frightened for 1 round. <br /><br />Form of the Monkey: You gain a bonus on damage rolls while prone equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum +0). You can crawl up to half your speed as a move action. At 8th level, whenever a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from you, that creature is considered flatfooted against your attack. At 15th level, whenever you take a 5-foot step, you are treated as if you were still in your original space for the purposes of flanking others until the start of your next turn (though you can&rsquo;t use this aspect to provide flanking for yourself), and you can crawl up to your full speed as a move action. <br /><br />Form of the Panther: You gain a bonus to damage rolls for retaliatory unarmed strikes made with <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Panther%20Style\">Panther Style</a> equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum +0). At 8th level, this bonus increases to twice your Wisdom modifier. At 15th level, if a creature misses an attack of opportunity against you prompted by your movement through a threatened square, you can make a retaliatory unarmed strike against that creature, even if you would not normally be able to make any more retaliatory strikes this turn. <br /><br />Form of the Snake: Once per round when you hit a single foe with two or more unarmed strikes and deal piercing damage on your turn, you knock that foe off-balance. The foe is flat-footed until the start of its turn. At 8th level, a foe you knock off-balance can&rsquo;t take attacks of opportunity until the start of its turn and remains flat-footed until the end of its turn. At 15th level, when you confirm a critical hit, the target is knocked off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity from you and your allies. <br /><br />Form of the Snapping Turtle: You double your shield bonus to AC from <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Snapping%20Turtle%20Style\">Snapping Turtle Style</a>. At 8th level, you still gain your shield bonus to AC from <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Snapping%20Turtle%20Style\">Snapping Turtle Style</a> even when you don&rsquo;t have one hand free. At 15th level, there is a 10% chance that critical hits and sneak attacks fail to affect you. This stacks with the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fortification%20(light)\">light fortification</a> armor special ability and similar effects. <br /><br />Form of the Tiger: On a successful bull rush, overrun, or trip combat maneuver, you deal slashing damage equal to your Strength bonus to the target of the maneuver. This damage increases to twice your Strength bonus at 8th level. At 15th level, if you hit with two or more unarmed strikes and deal slashing damage on your turn, you also rend your target, dealing damage equal to your unarmed strike plus 1-1/2 your Strength bonus.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shifter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_34.jpg","_id":"lC8l1FPgWaN8MMFq"}
