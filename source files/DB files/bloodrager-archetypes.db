For most, their rage is a conduit for the eldritch power locked in their heritage, but for a rageshaper, the latent magical energies in his blood bring about physical transformations and facilitate the blending of arcana and aggression into a deadly synthesis that few other barbarians (or even other bloodragers) can match.<br /><br />Bestial Aspect (Su): At 4th level, whenever a rageshaper gains a natural attack through the use of a polymorph spell, he can increase the damage done by that attack by one die. If the spell grants multiple natural attacks, the rageshaper must choose one kind of natural attack for the ability to enhance. At 9th level, if the rageshaper&rsquo;s altered form grants him a new mode of movement, that movement&rsquo;s base speed increases by 10 feet. This is an enhancement bonus. If the rageshaper&rsquo;s bloodrage powers already grant natural attacks or alternate modes of movement, then the bonuses granted by bestial aspect also apply to these bloodrage powers. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.<br /><br />Furious Transformation (Su): At 5th level, a rageshaper can attempt to bolster any transmutation spell from the bloodrager spell list with the polymorph subschool while bloodraging. The rageshaper must succeed at a concentration check as if casting defensively to modify the spell; otherwise, the spell is wasted. If he succeeds, the spell is treated as if the rageshaper had the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Extend%20Spell\">Extend Spell</a>&nbsp;metamagic feat. The rageshaper must be the spell&rsquo;s intended target or cast a spell with a range of personal to gain this effect. If the rageshaper casts a spell that is linked to the rageshaper&rsquo;s own bloodline, such as a rageshaper with the elemental bloodline who casts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=elemental%20body%20I\">elemental body I</a>, the spell is automatically extended without forcing the concentration check, so long as the rageshaper casts it while in a bloodrage.

The bloody-knuckled rowdy focuses on tricks and maneuvers that are quick and effective, duplicating combat styles from professional brawlers, street thugs, and even trapped animals. Rather than focusing on a single style, most bloody-knuckled rowdies dabble in multiple techniques, mixing and matching their array of vicious maneuvers to suit the occasion.<br /><br />Bloody Knuckles: The bloody-knuckled rowdy does not gain damage reduction.<br /><br />Reduced Spells Known: The bloody-knuckled rowdy focuses more on fighting tactics and less on his natural arcane powers. He receives one fewer spell known at each spell level.

When left incomplete&mdash;by virtue of a wily changeling&rsquo;s escape or her mother&rsquo;s death&mdash;the creature is scarred and saturated in arcane power. Though she remains in possession of her own faculties, the seeds of hag hatred sprout within her. These hag-riven wield powerful magic interlaced with more powerful emotions.<br /><br />The painful rituals that create a hag-riven can work for any creatures tenacious enough to endure them, and the art has sprung up as a defense against the devastating power of hags in various remote communities.<br /><br />Arcane Influence: A hag-riven bloodrager does not gain proficiency with martial weapons and must choose from one of the following bloodrager bloodlines:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Arcane\">arcane</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Destined\">destined</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Elemental\">elemental</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fey\">fey</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Hag\">hag</a>.<br /><br />This alters the bloodrager&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Claws of the Hag (Ex): A hag-riven grows a pair of vicious claws that are treated as natural weapons. These claws are primary attacks and deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 for a Small creature) plus the hag-riven&rsquo;s Strength modifier. At 2nd level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 5th level, the damage increases to 1d6 points (1d4 for a Small creature). At 13th level, the hag-riven&rsquo;s claws threaten a critical hit on a natural roll of 19&ndash;20. At 16th level, the damage increases again to 1d8 points (1d6 for a Small creature).<br /><br />This replaces fast movement and uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Sorcerous Claws (Su): At 5th level, a hag-riven can expend one of her daily spell slots as a swift action to grant her claws an enhancement bonus equal to the level of the spell slot sacrificed. This bonus lasts for 1 minute and stacks with existing enhancement bonuses (such as those provided by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=magic%20fang\">magic fang</a>&nbsp;or magic items) to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.<br /><br />Beginning at 7th level, the hag-riven can also expend some or all of the bonus provided by her sorcerous claws to add any of the following weapon properties to her claws for 1 minute:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flaming%20Burst\">flaming burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Frost\">frost</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Icy%20Burst\">icy burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Keen\">keen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Nullifying\">nullifying</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Seaborn\">seaborne</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Spellstealing\">spellstealing</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shock\">shock</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shocking%20Burst\">shocking burst</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wounding\">wounding</a>.

In many barbarian tribes, the true stature of a warrior is determined by his skill and ferocity on horseback. Other tribes measure it in skill atop whatever terrible mounts their people employ. A number of bloodragers are not only skilled in the art of mounted combat, but have learned to channel their arcane energies directly into their mount.<br /><br />Fast Rider (Ex): The bloodrider is adept at pushing his mount to its limit. The speed of any mount the bloodrager rides increases by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.<br /><br />Feral Mount (Ex): At 5th level, the bloodrider gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Companion\">druid&rsquo;s animal companion</a>, using the bloodrager&rsquo;s level &ndash; 4 as his effective druid level. This companion must be one he is capable of riding and suitable as a mount. A Medium bloodrider can select a camel or a horse. A Small bloodrider can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or riding dog if he is at least 8th level. Whenever a bloodrider is bloodraging, this feral mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Blood Bond (Su): At 9th level, the bloodrider and his feral mount gain a closer bond that allows the bloodrider to augment his mount based on his bloodline. While the bloodrider is bloodraging and on his feral mount, he grants the mount all the immunities and resistances he gains from bloodline powers. Furthermore, whenever the bloodrager is affected by a spell or spell-like ability with the range of personal while on the feral mount, the feral mount also gains the benefit of that spell.

Though she lacks the untamed resilience of her wilder fellows, she&rsquo;s an expert at keeping her rage from causing collateral damage in crowds.<br /><br />Class Skills: An urban bloodrager adds Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), and Profession (Wis) as class skills, and removes Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), and Survival (Wis). This alters the bloodrager&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An urban bloodrager isn&rsquo;t proficient with shields. This alters the bloodrager&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Controlled Bloodrage: When an urban bloodrager rages, she does not gain the normal benefits. Instead, she can apply a +4 morale bonus to her Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater bloodrage and to +8 when she gains mighty bloodrage. She can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. When using a controlled bloodrage, an urban bloodrager gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and can still use Charisma-, Dexterity-, and Intelligence-based skills. A controlled bloodrage still counts as a bloodrage for the purposes of any spells, feats, and other effects. This ability alters bloodrage.<br /><br />Restrained Magic (Su): At 3rd level, an urban bloodrager can attune her spells so they are less likely to impact her allies or innocent bystanders. When the bloodrager casts a spell, she can grant a +2 bonus on the saving throw against that spell to any creatures she is aware of that are targeted by the spell or within the spell&rsquo;s area. Any creature that receives this bonus and succeeds at its save is unaffected by the spell, as if it hadn&rsquo;t been targeted or wasn&rsquo;t in the area. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.<br /><br />Adopted Magic: At 7th level, an urban bloodrager learns some of the secrets of other magical traditions from other denizens of the city. She can select from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Class=Bard\">bard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Class=Magus\">magus</a>&nbsp;spell list any spell of a level she can cast, and add it to her bloodrager spell list and to her bloodrager spells known. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to her spell list and spells known. If she chooses to learn a new spell in place of an old one, she can exchange a bard or magus spell for another. This ability replaces damage reduction.<br /><br />Bloodline: The following bloodlines are especially suitable for an urban bloodrager, reflecting either a more nuanced origin or ancestry from city-dwelling magical creatures:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Aberrant\">aberrant</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Arcane\">arcane</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Celestial\">celestial</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Destined\">destined</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Infernal\">infernal</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/BloodragerBloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Undead\">undead</a>.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Bloodrager","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_12.jpg"}

Many perish or succumb to their bloodlust long before arriving at the school, but those who survive that journey and dedicate themselves to Jatembe&rsquo;s teachings eventually learn to control their anger and suppress the worst influences of their bloodlines.<br /><br />Once a bloodrager takes the teachings of the Magaambya into her heart and mind, she unlocks a unique method of casting her violent, rage-fueled spells. As a result, an enlightened bloodrager&rsquo;s magic looks, feels, and functions quite differently from the magic of other bloodragers. In many cases, when an enlightened bloodrager encounters a more traditional bloodrager, the meeting is laced with tension and suspicion. The enlightened bloodrager is, of course, well aware of the other bloodrager&rsquo;s tendency toward violence, and the other bloodrager is often unnerved by the calm and reasoned mannerisms of his enlightened counterpart. Many bloodragers even take offense at this demeanor, interpreting the enlightened bloodrager as a pawn of intellectuals or as having dishonored her ancestry or traditions by abandoning emotion and wrath. As one can well expect, such confrontations rarely result in lasting friendships!<br /><br />Enlightened Spellcasting: An enlightened bloodrager&rsquo;s unusually sophisticated outlook on the relationship between magic and emotional outbursts allows her to cast an expanded array of spells. She gains the ability to know and cast 0-level spells, which are cast like any other spells, but don&rsquo;t consume spell slots and can be used again. At 4th level, she gains a number of 0-level spells known equal to those of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bard\">bard</a>&nbsp;whose level is 3 lower than her bloodrager level. She selects these 0-level spells from the druid&rsquo;s list of 0-level spells.<br /><br />At 4th level, the enlightened bloodrager gains one 1st-level&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Class=Druid\">druid spell</a>&nbsp;as a bonus spell known. At 7th level, she gains one 2nd-level druid spell as a bonus spell known. At 10th level, she gains one 3rd-level druid spell as a bonus spell known. At 13th level, she gains one 4th-level druid spell as a bonus spell known.<br /><br />The bloodrager treats any druid spells she takes with this ability as bloodrager spells for the purposes of other abilities, and adds them to her bloodrager class spell list.

These steelbloods plod around the battlefield inspiring fear and delivering carnage from within a steel shell.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A steelblood gains proficiency in heavy armor. A steelblood can cast bloodrager spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring an arcane spell failure chance. This replaces the bloodrager&rsquo;s armor proficiency.<br /><br />Indomitable Stance (Ex): At 1st level, a steelblood gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks, to CMD against overrun combat maneuvers, and on Reflex saving throws against trample attacks. He also gains a +1 bonus to his AC against charge attacks and on attack and damage rolls against charging creatures. This ability replaces fast movement.<br /><br />Armored Swiftness (Ex): At 2nd level, a steelblood moves faster in medium and heavy armor. When wearing medium or heavy armor, a steelblood can move 5 feet faster than normal in that armor, to a maximum of his unencumbered speed. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.<br /><br />Armor Training (Ex): At 5th level, a steelblood learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every 4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), these bonuses increase by 1, to a maximum 4-point reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus.

The dwarven inhabitants used powerful magic explosives to seal the fortress against the outside world and prevent the Sky Citadel from becoming a pawn in the arcane wars between the two powers. Only with the arrival of Ancil Alkenstar in 4588 AR did Dongun Hold reopen itself to the outside world. By then, the constant exposure to strange runic energies and the long isolation had caused a unique form of rune-wielding berserker spellcaster to develop, though the symbol striker tradition has since spread beyond its origins.<br /><br />Skills: A symbol striker gains Linguistics as a class skill, but does not gain Handle Animal as a class skill.<br /><br />This alters the bloodrager&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Rune Training (Sp): A symbol striker can cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Read%20Magic\">read magic</a>&nbsp;at will and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Comprehend%20Languages\">comprehend languages</a>&nbsp;once per day, but only to decipher written text.

The spell forms itself into a brightly glowing rune, which is obvious to a casual observer. This ability functions only while the symbol striker wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon ceases granting this ability until it is returned to the symbol striker. The symbol striker can have only a single weapon rune active at a time; if he casts an additional weapon rune while a previous rune is active, the earlier rune fades. Weapon runes also fade when the symbol striker regains his spell slots for the day. Otherwise, the rune remains until the spell is discharged or dispelled. At 12th level, a symbol striker can use this ability twice per day. At 18th level, he can use this ability three times per day.<br /><br />As a standard action, the symbol striker can make a melee attack with a weapon that has an active weapon rune and, if the attack is successful, deal normal weapon damage and also expend the weapon rune to discharge the stored spell into the target, as if delivering the spell with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Magus\">magus spellstrike class feature</a>.<br /><br />This replaces the bloodline feats gained at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.<br /><br />Rune Trap (Sp): At 9th level, as a standard action, the symbol striker can use a melee weapon to place a rune trap in any adjacent square. Any creature entering a square containing a rune trap takes 1d6 points of damage plus 1 additional point of damage for every 2 bloodrager levels the symbol striker has. This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, which is decided at the rune&rsquo;s creation. The rune is clearly visible and lasts a number of minutes equal to the symbol striker&rsquo;s bloodrager level or until discharged. A symbol striker cannot create a rune trap in a square occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purpose of dispelling. A creature can disarm the rune by succeeding at a DC 26 Disable Device check.

He gains access to the feats, bonus spells, and some of the powers of both bloodlines he is descended from, but at the cost of reducing mental clarity (see Drawbacks below). If the crossblooded rager already has a bloodline from another class, one of the chosen bloodlines must be that bloodline.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: A crossblooded rager combines the bonus feat lists from both of his bloodlines and can select his bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.<br /><br />Bonus Spells: A crossblooded rager can select his bonus spells from either of his bloodlines. He can also learn a lower-level bonus spell he did not choose in place of the higher-level bonus spell he would normally gain. Lowerlevel bonus spells learned in this manner are always the spell level that they would be if the crossblooded rager had learned them with the appropriate bonus spell.<br /><br />For example: A 7th-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded rager has the choice of learning&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=enlarge%20person\">enlarge person</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=ray%20of%20enfeeblement\">ray of enfeeblement</a>&nbsp;as his bloodline bonus spell. If he selected&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=ray%20of%20enfeeblement\">ray of enfeeblement</a>&nbsp;as his 7th-level bonus spell, at 10th level he could use his new bonus spell to learn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=enlarge%20person\">enlarge person</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=bull%E2%80%99s%20strength\">bull&rsquo;s strength</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=see%20invisibility\">see invisibility</a>, and he would add it to his list of 1st-level spells known (just as if he had learned it as his 7th-level bonus spell).<br /><br />Bloodline Powers: At 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels, a crossblooded rager gains one of the two new bloodline powers available to him at that level. He can instead select a lower-level bloodline power he did not choose in place of one of these high-level powers.<br /><br />Drawbacks: The furious mix of arcane power inside a crossblooded rager forces him to constantly expend mental effort to remain focused on his current situation and needs. This leaves him with less mental resolve available to deal with external threats. A crossblooded rager takes a &ndash;2 penalty to all Will saving throws at all times, and does not gain the +2 morale bonus on Will saving throws while bloodraging&mdash;though he does gain a +1 morale bonus Will saving throws when he gains the greater bloodrage class feature, which increases to a +2 morale bonus on saving throws upon gaining the mighty bloodrage class feature.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Bloodrager","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_12.jpg"}

Ancestral harbingers are particularly common among Shoanti bloodragers and among Bonuwat tribes living along the coast of western Garund.<br /><br />Spirit Guardian (Sp): At 2nd level, an ancestral harbinger can call upon her ancestors to aid her in combat, summoning a weapon of force that functions as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=spiritual%20weapon\">spiritual weapon</a>. At 6th level, her ancestral spirit can take the form of a savage creature, functioning as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20nature%E2%80%99s%20ally%202\">summon nature&rsquo;s ally II</a>&nbsp;(this can&rsquo;t be used to summon multiple creatures from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20nature%E2%80%99s%20ally%201\">summon nature&rsquo;s ally I</a>&nbsp;list). At 12th level, her ancestor can manifest physically as a ghostly figure, functioning as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=spiritual%20ally\">spiritual ally</a>. At 18th level, her ancestral spirit can manifest either as a single powerful creature or as multiple lesser ancestors, functioning as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20nature%E2%80%99s%20ally%206\">summon nature&rsquo;s ally VI</a>. The harbinger chooses which spell this ability functions as at the time of casting, and can use this ability while in a bloodrage. The ancestral harbinger can use this ability once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 4 bloodrager levels she possesses beyond 2nd. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and the bloodline feats gained at 6th and 18th levels.<br /><br />Spirit Servants: At 5th level, an ancestral harbinger adds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20monster%20I\">summon monster I</a>&nbsp;to her class spell list and gains it as a bonus spell known. She also gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20monster%20II\">summon monster II</a>&nbsp;at 8th level,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20monster%20III\">summon monster III</a>&nbsp;at 11th level, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20monster%20IV\">summon monster IV</a>&nbsp;at 14th level. These spells can be used only to summon types of monsters with strong ties to the ancestral harbinger&rsquo;s family history, ranging from clan totems to monsters of the same type as those famously killed by her forebears. For each of these spells, the ancestral harbinger selects a number of monsters she can summon equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to represent these spirits. These monsters are selected from the options on the summon monster creature list or the expanded summoning list (see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MasterSummonList.aspx?SummonType=monster\">summoning project</a>) that are appropriate for the spell level. At 7th level and every 2 bloodrager levels thereafter, the ancestral harbinger can swap one selected monster from one of these spells for a new monster from the same level&rsquo;s summoning lists.<br /><br />The ancestral harbinger has a mystic tie to the spirit servants summoned with this ability. When the ancestral harbinger is in a bloodrage, all of her spirit servants gain a +2 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The spirit servants also gain 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. At 11th level, the morale bonus increases to +3 and the number of temporary hit points per Hit Die increases to 3. At 20th level, the morale bonus increases to +4 and the number of temporary hit points per Hit Die increases to 4. The morale bonus and temporary hit points last until the bloodrage ends. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge and the bloodline feat gained at 12th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Bloodrager","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_12.jpg"}

The prowler does not have access to the archmage or hierophant legends.
