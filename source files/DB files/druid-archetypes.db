Rather than merely copying humanoids&rsquo; shapes and abilities, skinshapers unlock brutal energies that push their borrowed bodies far beyond the capabilities of normal humanoid creatures. Their connection to humanoids bring skinshapers into settlements more often than typical druids, and their penchant for disguise allows them to excel at intrigue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Class Skills: A skinshaper adds Disguise to her list of class skills, instead of Ride.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This alters the druid&rsquo;s class skills.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Skinshaping (Su): At 4th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium humanoid and back again once per day. This ability functions as per alter self, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until the skinshaper changes back. Changing form is a standard action and doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity. The skinshaper must be familiar with the form she has chosen. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, up to a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, she can use skinshaping at will. The skinshaper learns to intuitively use her body as a weapon. While skinshaping, she gains the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, and her unarmed strike deals damage as if she were a monk with a monk level equal to her druid level &ndash; 3.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 6th level, a skinshaper gains the ability to channel the versatile nature of humanoids to enhance her body and mind. Whenever she uses skinshaping to assume a humanoid shape other than her own, she gains a +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score. The bonus persists as long as she remains in that form. At 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, she gains an additional +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. She can distribute these bonuses as she wishes in increments of +2, but the enhancement bonus on any single ability score cannot exceed +4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 8th level, a skinshaper can imitate humanoid creatures even more accurately. She gains any of the following abilities that the form she assumes has: darkvision 90 feet, low-light vision, scent, climb 60 feet, fly 60 feet (good maneuverability), swim 60 feet, ferocity, orc ferocity, and hold breath. If the form she assumes has the aquatic subtype, she gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 12th level, a skinshaper can access the racial memory of the humanoid she is imitating. If the form she assumes has any of the following racial abilities, she gains those abilities: defensive training, hatred, poison use, sneak attack +2d6, stability, and weapon familiarity. Additionally, she can speak any racial languages of the chosen form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 16th level, a skinshaper gains the racial skill bonuses of the imitated humanoid, to a maximum of a +4 bonus on a given skill. The skinshaper cannot benefit from any variable racial skill bonuses associated with the chosen form (such as gnomes&rsquo; racial bonus on any one Craft or Profession skill).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This ability replaces wild shape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flashmorph (Su): At 13th level, a skinshaper learns to change her shape extremely quickly.

A feral child may not choose urban as a favored terrain. This ability replaces trackless step and a thousand faces.<br /><br />Native Cunning (Ex): At 3rd level, a feral child gains trap sense as a barbarian of equal level, and in her favored terrain, she immediately receives a Perception check to notice traps within 10 feet, as the trap spotter rogue talent. In addition, at 3rd level and every three levels thereafter, she may choose one combat maneuver, and gains a bonus equal to her trap sense bonus to her CMD against that maneuver.

Some druids hear their call keenly and are able to effortlessly incarnate them as the miniature creatures known as leshys (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 176). The leshy warden serves as these spirits&rsquo; ally, defender, and voice.<br /><br />Leshy Familiar (Ex): A leshy warden forms an intimate bond with a nature spirit, incarnating the spirit as a leaf leshy (Bestiary 3 179). She gains a leaf leshy as a familiar and treats her druid level as her effective wizard level for the purpose of this ability. If the leshy dies, the leshy warden can incarnate the same spirit again by paying the normal cost to replace a familiar. So long as the leshy lives, the leshy warden gains access to the Plant domain as if through a druid&rsquo;s nature bond class feature, but she can&rsquo;t choose the Decay subdomain.<br /><br />This replaces nature bond.<br /><br />Green Empathy (Ex): A leshy warden can improve the attitude of a plant creature as if using wild empathy. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. If the plant creature is mindless, the leshy warden imparts a modicum of intellect to the plant so that it can be interacted with as if it were an animal. A leshy warden can also use this ability to influence an animal, but she takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the check to do so.<br /><br />This replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Leshy Summoner (Ex): A leshy warden is an expert at summoning and growing leshys. She counts as a plant creature for the purpose of growing leshys. She adds leaf leshys, gourd leshys, fungus leshys, seaweed leshys, and lotus leshys to her list of creatures she can summon with summon nature&rsquo;s ally I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively.<br /><br />This alters spontaneous casting.<br /><br />Leshy Tender (Ex): At 4th level, a leshy warden can either grant her leaf leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a gourd leshy. At 8th level, the leshy warden can either grant her current leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a fungus leshy. At 12th level, she can either grant her current leshy a final +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a seaweed leshy. If the leshy is transformed, it gains the normal ability scores of its new form; ability score increases granted by this ability don&rsquo;t carry over to its new form.<br /><br />This replaces resist nature&rsquo;s lure.<br /><br />Wild Shape (Su): A leshy warden gains this ability at 6th level, except her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &ndash; 2 for the purpose of determining the number of times per day she can use it. At 6th level, the leshy warden can assume the form of only Small or Medium plant creatures, as per plant shape I. At 8th level, she can take the form of a Large plant creature, as per plant shape II.

Through acting as a herald to the naga deities, the aspirant is rewarded with the ability to unlock her ultimate spirit form and become a true naga. A naga aspirant has the following class features.<br /><br />Aspirant&rsquo;s Bond (Ex): A naga aspirant gains a spiritual connection to the serpentine deities worshiped by the nagas. At 1st level, and each time she gains a druid level, she may add one of the following spells to her druid spell list. <br /><br />0&mdash;acid splash, bleed, daze, mage hand, open/close, ray of frost; 1st&mdash;charm person, divine favor, expeditious retreat, mage armor, magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, shield, shield of faith, silent image, true strike; 2nd&mdash;acid arrow, detect thoughts, invisibility, mirror image, scorching ray, see invisibility; 3rd&mdash;dispel magic, displacement, fireball, lightning bolt, suggestion; 4th&mdash;divine power, greater invisibility. <br /><br />This ability replaces spontaneous casting.<br /><br />Aspirant&rsquo;s Enlightenment (Ex): At 4th level, a naga aspirant gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and poison of nagas. This ability replaces resist nature&rsquo;s lure.<br /><br />Naga Shape (Su): At 6th level, the naga aspirant can use her wild shape ability (gained at 4th level, as normal) to assume the form of a true naga. This effect functions in a similar manner to a shapechange spell with the following exception. The druid&rsquo;s true naga form is unique, representing her personal evolution. When taking naga form, the nagaji&rsquo;s body transforms into that of a large serpent, though she keeps her own head. The naga aspirant loses her limbs and her size increases by one category, granting her a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a &ndash;2 penalty to Dexterity, and a +2 enhancement bonus to her natural armor bonus. She gains a +10 enhancement bonus to land speed and a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. She can cast verbal spells in this form, but cannot cast spells with other components without metamagic or feats such as Natural Spell. This otherwise works like and replaces wild shape.<br /><br />Augmented Form (Su): At 9th level and every four levels thereafter, a naga aspirant can choose one of the following abilities to enhance her naga form. Once chosen, this augmentation cannot be changed and always applies to her naga form. The caster level for these abilities is equal to her druid level, and unless otherwise stated, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the druid&rsquo;s class level + the druid&rsquo;s Charisma bonus. This ability replaces venom immunity, a thousand faces, and timeless body. <br /><br />Charming Gaze (Sp): The druid gains a gaze attack that affects creatures within 30 feet as a charm person spell. <br />Darkvision (Su): The druid gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. <br />Detect Thoughts (Su): The druid can use detect thoughts at will. <br />Guarded Thoughts (Ex): The druid gains a +2 racial bonus on saves against charm effects and immunity to any form of mind reading (such as detect thoughts). <br />Poison Immunity (Ex): The druid gains immunity to all poisons. The druid&rsquo;s naga form must have at least one poison-based natural attack in order to select this ability. <br />Poisonous Sting (Ex): The druid&rsquo;s stinger becomes venomous. The naga form must have a tail stinger to take this ability. Sting&mdash;injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the druid&rsquo;s class level + the druid&rsquo;s Constitution modifier; frequency 1 round; effect sleep for 2d4 minutes; cure 1 save. <br />Spit Venom (Ex): The naga form can spit her venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Any opponent hit by this attack must make a successful save (see above) to avoid the effect. The naga form must have a venomous bite to take this ability. <br />Sting (Ex): The naga form grows a stinger on the end of her tail, granting her a sting natural attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage. <br />Swim (Ex): The naga form gains a swim speed equal to her base speed. <br />Tough Scales (Ex): The druid&rsquo;s enhancement bonus to her natural armor increases by +2. The druid may select this ability more than once. Its effects stack. <br />Venomous Bite (Ex): The naga form&rsquo;s bite attack becomes poisonous. Bite&mdash;injury; save Fortitude DC 10 + 1/2 the druid&rsquo;s class level + the druid&rsquo;s Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Constitution damage, cure 1 save.<br /><br />True Naga (Su): At 20th level, a naga aspirant metamorphoses into a unique naga. Her wild shape form becomes her natural form, though she can transform into her original nagaji shape at will. Her creature type permanently changes to aberration.

They act as ambassadors and protectors of the old ways, nurturing their tribe&rsquo;s growth and holding back civilization&rsquo;s corruptive influence.<br /><br />Ancient Arms: An ancient guardian can&rsquo;t wield weapons made primarily of metal. She is proficient with only the club, dart, quarterstaff, shortspear, sling, and spear. She is also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form she assumes with wild shape. Using a prohibited weapon renders her unable to cast druid spells or use any of her druid supernatural or spell-like class abilities while wielding the weapon and for 24 hours after ceasing to wield it. This alters the druid&rsquo;s normal weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />Community Bond (Ex): At 1st level, an ancient guardian must choose the domain nature bond ability and select from the following domains: Community, Healing, Knowledge, Protection, or Repose. This ability alters nature bond.<br /><br />Patience of Nature (Ex): An ancient guardian does not gain wild empathy at 1st level. Instead, at 2nd level, an ancient guardian adds Diplomacy, Perform (oratory), and Sense Motive to her list of class skills and gains an insight bonus equal to half her druid level on such checks. This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Ancient Ways (Ex): At 3rd level, an ancient guardian increases any climb, fly, or swim speeds she has or gains via her wild shape ability by 10 feet. This ability replaces trackless step and woodland stride.<br /><br />Dispel Hostility (Su): An ancient guardian doesn&rsquo;t gain spontaneous casting at 1st level. Instead, at 3rd level, she can channel stored spell energy into a spell capable of dispelling hostile thoughts and strong emotions. She can &ldquo;lose&rdquo; a prepared spell in order to cast calm emotions. Instead of the normal Will saving throw for that spell, the DC of a calm emotions spell cast with this ability is 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian&rsquo;s druid level + her Wisdom modifier.

If her target is entering the wild, it treats every square of wilderness not on a road or in a building as difficult terrain. If her target is exiting the wild, it treats every square on a road or inside a building as difficult terrain. In either case, the ground feels uneven and the target suffers extreme vertigo during movement. The victim of this curse can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the road keeper&rsquo;s level + her Wisdom modifier) at the beginning of its turn each round to end the effect. The effect lasts until the target successfully saves or for a number of minutes equal to the road keeper&rsquo;s level.

Progenitors are druids who tap into the vibrant power of the First World to propagate natural and supernatural wonders.<br /><br />Infused Summoning (Ex): When a progenitor casts summon nature&rsquo;s ally to summon a creature, the summoned creature gains fast healing equal to the progenitor&rsquo;s level (maximum equal to the progenitor&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier).<br /><br />This alters spontaneous casting.<br /><br />Primal Bond (Ex): A progenitor infuses herself with fey magic so that she is treated as either her original creature type or the fey type for the purposes of spells or effects that target a creature by type, whichever is more beneficial to her. Additionally, the progenitor chooses one of two forms through which this bond expresses itself: magic or nature.<br /><br />A progenitor who chooses magic as her primal bond can draw upon wild magic as a swift action to attempt to cast a prepared spell without losing that spell from its spell slot. To use this ability, she casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell&rsquo;s effects take place, she must attempt a concentration check (DC = 20 + twice the spell&rsquo;s level). If she fails, she expends the spell normally as if she had cast it, but its effects are replaced by a wild magic effect (see page 63) with a CR equal to her caster level and she is staggered until the end of her next turn. If she succeeds, she casts the spell normally and it is not expended from her prepared spell slot, allowing her to cast that spell again at a later point. A progenitor can use wild magic in this manner once per day plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.<br /><br />A progenitor who chooses nature as her primal bond can create plants as a full-round action. She can do so once per day plus one additional time per day per 5 levels. At the start of her next turn, so long as she is touching a solid surface underfoot, a 5-foot radius of mobile undergrowth springs to life around the progenitor for a number of rounds equal to 3 plus the progenitor&rsquo;s Wisdom bonus. Upon activating this ability, the progenitor chooses whether the undergrowth provides cover or difficult terrain. If the progenitor chooses cover, her undergrowth provides a cover bonus to AC to the progenitor and allies within the radius. If she chooses difficult terrain, enemies who enter the radius of undergrowth treat it as difficult terrain. A progenitor&rsquo;s undergrowth is treated as forest terrain if it provides cover and plains terrain if it provides difficult terrain. This radius increases by 5 feet at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.<br /><br />This replaces nature bond.<br /><br />Fey Shape (Su): A progenitor never gains the ability to use wild shape to transform into an elemental.<br /><br />At 6th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Small or Medium fey. When doing so, her wild shape functions as fey form I.<br /><br />At 8th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Tiny or Large fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form II.<br /><br />At 10th level, a progenitor can use wild shape to change into a Diminutive or Huge fey. When she does so, her wild shape functions as fey form III.<br /><br />At 14th level, when a progenitor uses wild shape to assume a fey form, her wild shape functions as fey form IV.<br /><br />This alters wild shape.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Druid","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/leaf-jade-3.jpg","_id":"G0LoRkXDWFyNa3LJ"}

The first is a close tie to the plane to which she is aligned, granting the planar extremist one of the domains of her alignment (for example, a lawful good planar extremist could take either the Lawful or Good domain). This option otherwise functions as a druid&rsquo;s nature bond if she chose a close tie to the natural world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an outsider from an Outer Plane. The abilities of this outsider companion are determined using the rules for eidolons for the unchained summonerPU class, as if the planar extremist were a summoner of her druid level, except the outsider companion gains no additional evolution pool (only the evolutions from its base form and base evolutions for its subtype), and it must be of a subtype whose alignment exactly matches the alignment of the planar extremist. The planar extremist can summon her outsider companion with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so, but she can&rsquo;t cast summon monster spells if she currently has her outsider companion summoned, and she can&rsquo;t summon her companion if she already has a creature summoned through other means.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the planar ally gains class levels, her eidolon&rsquo;s base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level.

When using inspiration on an attack roll against an animal or a vermin or on a saving throw against an effect from an animal or a vermin, a wild whisperer has to expend only one use of inspiration instead of two. This ability replaces the additional use of wild shape at 6th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Investigator Talent: At 8th level, wild whisperer selects an investigator talent (see page 32).

{"name":"Druid (Treesinger)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source Advanced Race Guide pg. 25</p>\n<p>This archetype may also be taken by a Vine Leshy (see Ultimate Wilderness pg. 22)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Elves live far longer than other common races, and a single elf may see whole empires rise and fall. Given the impermanence of the cultures around them, it&rsquo;s small wonder that some elves turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest&rsquo;s plants into combat. A treesinger has the following class features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plant Bond (Ex): At 1st level, a treesinger forms a mystic bond with plant life. This bond can take one of two forms. The first grants the treesinger one of the following domains: Plant (Core Rulebook); Growth ; Jungle, Swamp. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the treesinger&rsquo;s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A treesinger who selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot, and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with a plant companion. A treesinger may begin play with any of the plants listed in Plant Companions. This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the treesinger on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list of plant companions, this ability otherwise works like the standard druid&rsquo;s animal companion ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plant bond replaces the druid&rsquo;s nature bond ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Green Empathy (Ex): At 1st level, a treesinger can improve the attitude of a plant creature. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The treesinger rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To use green empathy, the treesinger and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A treesinger can also use this ability to influence an animal, but she takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the check. This ability replaces the wild empathy class feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wild Shape (Su): At 4th level, a treesinger gains the ability to wild shape. This ability functions at her actual druid level. A treesinger cannot use wild shape to adopt an animal or elemental form. Instead, when she gains this ability at 4th level, she can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant. This functions as plant shape I, except the treesinger does not yet gain access to the constrict or poison abilities of the plant form assumed. At 8th level, the treesinger&rsquo;s wild shape gains the full range of abilities available from plant shape I. At 10th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Large or Tiny plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape II. At 12th level, a treesinger can assume the form of a Huge plant. Her wild shape ability now functions like plant shape III. This ability replaces, and otherwise functions like, the normal druid wild shape ability.</p>\n<p>Plant Companions</p>\n<p>Each plant companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All plant attacks are made using the creature&rsquo;s full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant attacks add the plant&rsquo;s Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions cannot gain armor or weapon proficiency feats, even as they advance in hit dice, and cannot use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As you gain levels, your plant companion grows in power as well. It gains the same bonuses that are gained by animal companions. Each plant companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each plant choice. Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion&rsquo;s Strength and Constitution by 2.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Carnivorous Flower</p>\n<p>Starting Statistics: Size Small; Speed 30 ft., climb 10 ft.; AC +2 natural armor; Attack bite (1d6); Ability Scores Str 10, Dex 17, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 10; Special Qualities low-light vision, scent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4th-Level Advancement: Size Medium; Attack bite (2d6); Ability Scores Str +4, Dex &ndash;2, Con +2; Special Attacks rage (1/day, as the barbarian class feature for 6 rounds).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crawling Vine</p>\n<p>Starting Statistics: Size Medium; Speed 20 ft., climb 20 ft.; AC +2 natural armor; Attack slam (1d4); Ability Scores Str 13, Dex 17, Con 13, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2; Special Attacks grab; Special Qualities low-light vision, scent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4th-Level Advancement: Size Large; AC +1 natural armor; Attack slam (1d6); Ability Scores Str +8, Dex &ndash;2, Con +4; Special Attacks constrict 1d6.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Puffball (Floating Fungus)</p>\n<p>Starting Statistics: Size Small; Speed 20 ft., fly 60 ft.

These so-called tempest druids see the personification of nature in the fury of the storm alone and to some extent eschew the veneration of plant or animal life, and the nature of their powers shifts accordingly. They still understand the place of plants and animals in the natural order, however; they simply view such entities&mdash;and indeed, all forms of life&mdash;as subservient to the true power found in the storms that lash the world.<br /><br />Alignment: The beliefs held by tempest druids are inherently more chaotic than those held by most druids, and as a result, tempest druids must be chaotic neutral.<br /><br />This alters the druid&rsquo;s alignment.<br /><br />Armor and Weapon Proficiencies: A tempest druid is proficient with the trident, in addition to the druid&rsquo;s normal armor and weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />This alters the druid&rsquo;s armor and weapon proficiencies.<br /><br />Spontaneous Domain Casting: A tempest druid can channel stored spell energy into domain spells that he has not prepared ahead of time. He can &ldquo;lose&rdquo; a prepared spell to cast any domain spell of the same level or lower.<br /><br />This replaces the druid&rsquo;s normal ability to spontaneously cast summon spells.<br /><br />Nature Bond (Ex): As a result of his beliefs, a tempest druid has little connection to the spirituality of animals or plants. He can&rsquo;t choose an animal companion, and must instead select a domain or subdomain from the following list when he gains the nature bond ability: Air, AquaticUM, CloudAPG, StormAPG, SwampUM, Weather, or WindAPG.<br /><br />This alters nature bond.<br /><br />Sodden Shore Sense (Ex): A tempest druid gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks in coastal or marshy lands.<br /><br />This ability replaces nature sense.<br /><br />Electrical Resistance (Ex): At 3rd level, a tempest druid gains electricity resistance 5. As a standard action, he can transfer this resistance to another creature for 1 hour, after which time it reverts to him.<br /><br />This ability replaces trackless step.<br /><br />Eyes of the Storm (Ex): At 4th level, a tempest druid can see through 10 feet of magical fog, mist, rain, wind, or similar inclement weather conditions, ignoring any concealment such conditions might grant. This distance increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels beyond 4th.<br /><br />This ability replaces resist nature&rsquo;s lure.<br /><br />Bend Bolt (Su): At 9th level, a tempest druid can redirect nearby electrical attacks. As an immediate action, the druid can shift the area or target of an electricity attack by 5 feet in any direction. If the electricity affects an area, the druid selects one square to be unaffected and an adjacent square to be affected. If the adjacent square is already in the area, this has no additional effect in that square. If the electricity affects a target, the druid selects an adjacent target. For example, if he were in the line of a wizard&rsquo;s lightning bolt, he could have the spell skip his square and instead affect an adjacent square, even if this meant the spell did not form a continuous line. If another druid attacked him with call lightning, he could shift the called bolt to an adjacent square, affecting a creature in that square (if any).<br /><br />He can&rsquo;t redirect electricity damage conducted to him by physical contact with an object or creature (such as a shocking grasp or a shock weapon).

Though they revere the natural world, halcyon druids are less focused on emulating its inhabitants. Instead, like Old-Mage Jatembe, they treat with beings from the Outer Sphere. As a sign of their allegiance, these druids wear fantastical masks depicting celestials, fiends, and&mdash; most often&mdash;the bestial agathions.<br /><br />Halcyon druids are peacekeepers, mediating between people and nature, people and the spirit world, and different groups of people. Yet when necessary, they use their magic to fight enemies of peace, especially demons and demon cultists.<br /><br />Most halcyon druids serve Nantambu and the surrounding villages&mdash;making, memorizing, and arbitrating the unwritten pacts between them. Some halcyon druids, however, are drawn farther afield. They may do so to forge new connections between tribes and villages, to spread the message of peace, or to fight demonic outbreaks.<br /><br />Bonded Mask (Su): A halcyon druid forms a powerful bond with a mask, which functions identically to a wizard&rsquo;s bonded object except that it can be used to cast druid spells (including those gained from class abilities) instead of wizard spells. A bonded mask must be worn to have an effect, and it occupies the head slot. A halcyon druid can enhance her mask with abilities appropriate for a head slot item, and can designate an existing head slot item as her bonded mask (but only if it covers her face).<br /><br />This ability replaces nature bond.<br /><br />Magaambya-Trained (Ex): A halcyon druid adds Diplomacy and all Knowledge skills to her list of class skills.<br /><br />This ability replaces nature sense and alters the druid&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Peacekeeper (Ex): A halcyon druid adds half her class level (minimum 1) to Diplomacy and Knowledge (local) checks.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Spontaneous Casting: A halcyon druid adds all spells from the Good cleric domain to her druid spell list, and she can focus stored spell energy into spells from the Good domain that she hasn&rsquo;t prepared ahead of time. She can lose a prepared spell to cast any spell of the same level or lower from the Good domain.<br /><br />This ability replaces spontaneous casting.<br /><br />Natural Arcana (Su): At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a halcyon druid chooses two spells from the wizard/sorcerer spell list and adds them to her druid spell list. The chosen spells must be at least 1 level lower than the highest level spell she can currently cast. At 20th level, the halcyon druid can choose wizard/sorcerer spells of any level.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild shape.<br /><br />Resist Fiendish Influence (Ex): At 4th level, a halcyon druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of outsiders with the evil subtype and spells with the evil descriptor.<br /><br />This ability replaces resist nature&rsquo;s lure.<br /><br />Embody Mask (Sp): At 13th level, a halcyon druid wearing her bonded mask can embody the spirit it represents, which can be any Tiny to Large agathion, angel, archon, or azata. This ability requires a standard action to activate and functions as per beast shape IV (using the adjustments for magical beasts), but adds the following abilities if the assumed form has them: aura of menace, protective aura, speak with animals, telepathy, and truespeech. If the assumed form has immunity to a condition, the druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause that condition. A halcyon druid can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level.

These feyspeakers are often touched by the fey in some way, such as mortals who dared to eat the food and drink the wine while in the hidden halls of the fey.<br /><br />Fey Magic: At 1st level, a feyspeaker allows the strange idylls of the fey to guide her magic. The feyspeaker uses her Charisma score instead of her Wisdom score as her key spellcasting ability score (to determine her spell DCs, bonus spells per day, concentration checks, and so on). At 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels, a feyspeaker adds one enchantment or illusion spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her druid spell list as a spell of 1 level higher (for instance, at 4th level, she could add color spray as a 2nd-level druid spell). In order to select a spell, she must be of a level high enough (including the increased spell level) to cast it. Once selected, the spell cannot be changed.<br /><br />A feyspeaker loses the ability to spontaneously cast summon nature&rsquo;s ally spells. She gains the wild shape ability at 6th level and gains all benefits related to wild shape 2 druid levels later than usual. She can never use wild shape to transform into an elemental.<br /><br />This ability alters wild shape and spellcasting.<br /><br />Fey Speech (Ex): At 1st level, a feyspeaker&rsquo;s words carry a tiny fragment of the otherworldly power of the fey&rsquo;s voices. She gains Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, and Sense Motive as class skills. A feyspeaker also learns Sylvan as a bonus language. In addition, the feyspeaker gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 6 + her Intelligence modifier, instead of 4 + her Intelligence modifier. The feyspeaker&rsquo;s base attack bonus from her druid levels is equal to half her druid level (much like a sorcerer&rsquo;s base attack bonus is calculated), rather than the usual druid base attack bonus.<br /><br />This ability replaces nature sense and alters the druid&rsquo;s base attack bonus, class skills, and skills ranks per level.<br /><br />Wild Mischief (Ex): At 1st level, a feyspeaker can fool an animal into thinking there is food, a potential mate, or a predator nearby. This ability functions just like a Bluff check to deceive a character. To determine the result of the wild mischief check, the feyspeaker rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier. As with Bluff checks, wild mischief checks are modified depending on the believability of the false information. A typical domestic animal is not particularly suspicious of the feyspeaker (no circumstance modifier), whereas wild animals are usually suspicious (&ndash;5 penalty on the check). To use wild mischief, the feyspeaker and the animal must be able to study each other, which means they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but as when influencing people, it could take more or less time. A feyspeaker can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the check.<br /><br />This ability replaces the druid&rsquo;s proficiency with medium armor.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Druid","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/leaf-jade-3.jpg","_id":"Vz4aoXSbr4WiuMcD"}

His body becomes increasingly toxic, allowing him to secrete a deadly poison through his pores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Toxic Secretions (Su): At 1st level, an urushiol&rsquo;s body becomes capable of producing a single dose of poison per day. At 3rd level and every 2 druid levels thereafter, the number of daily doses increases by 1, to a maximum of 10 doses at 19th level. The urushiol&rsquo;s daily doses are replenished when he regains his spells, but any of his weapons that are still poisoned with urushiol venom count against his daily limit. The urushiol is immune to his own poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying his own poison or attacking with a weapon coated with it. Regardless of the delivery method he chooses, his poison has the following base statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Urushiol Venom: type poison (varies); save Fortitude negates; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the urushiol&rsquo;s level + his Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 1st level, an urushiol can secrete this poison as a numbing injury poison on a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon by spending 1 of his daily doses as a standard action. He must choose a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon in his hand that deals piercing or slashing damage and that is not already poisoned or poisonous. The weapon remains poisoned until the urushiol scores a hit with it, the weapon leaves his possession for more than 1 round, or the poison is wiped away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 4th level, an urushiol&rsquo;s body becomes so saturated with poison that even his flesh is poisonous. Whenever a creature damages the urushiol with a bite or swallow whole attack, the urushiol can release ingested poison into the creature by spending 1 of his daily doses as an immediate action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 7th level, an urushiol can spend 2 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to secrete a contact poison and coat one of his limbs with the secreted poison. The urushiol can deliver the poison by making a successful touch attack as a standard action, which can be part of the same standard action he used to secrete the poison. If the attack misses, the poison persists upon his limb throughout the subsequent rounds until he hits a target or touches something else with his poisoned limb.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 11th level, an urushiol can spend 3 daily doses of his poison as a standard action to release a 20-foot-radius cloud of inhaled poison centered around him that lasts for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 14th level, an urushiol&rsquo;s venom changes in frequency to 1/round for 4 rounds. In addition, when using his urushiol venom, an urushiol can spend an extra dose of his poison to change the damage type of the poison to Dexterity damage or Constitution damage. He can use this alteration in combination with any of the other abilities. For example, he could spend a total of 3 doses to create a cloud of inhaled poison that deals Constitution damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This ability replaces nature bond and resist nature&rsquo;s lure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Venom Immunity (Ex): An urushiol gains venom immunity at 4th level instead of 9th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This ability alters venom immunity.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Druid","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/leaf-jade-3.jpg","_id":"XUTTgfpvPvSEfhQ8"}

Despite this respect, a goliath druid doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to infiltrate giant groups who defile nature and destroy them from within.<br /><br />Goliath druids have the following class features.<br /><br />Class Skills: A goliath druid gains Bluff, Diplomacy, and Knowledge (local) as class skills, but does not gain Craft, Profession, and Ride as class skills.<br /><br />Bonus Languages: A goliath druid with an Intelligence bonus can select Giant as a bonus language.<br /><br />Primal Size: A goliath druid adds enlarge person to her list of class spells.

They transform intelligent creatures and domesticated animals into throwbacks to their feral ancestors.<br /><br />Devolved Companion (Ex): A devolutionist must choose a devolved humanoid as an animal companion for her nature bond. Use the stats for an ape animal companion, but at 4th level, the devolved humanoid doesn&rsquo;t increase to size Large (it still gains all the other benefits at 4th level).<br /><br />This ability alters nature bond. <br /><br />Undomesticate (Su): At 4th level, a devolutionist can spend 1 minute with a willing or restrained domesticated animal to undo the effects of domestication, transforming it into a wild animal and causing it to lose any tricks it knew. The animal no longer recognizes any humanoids as friends or allies and gladly tears former playmates apart for food. Handle Animal checks don&rsquo;t work on an undomesticated creature, though wild empathy does. This ability doesn&rsquo;t function on animal companions, special mounts, or the like, and other exceptional domesticated animals can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the devolutionist&rsquo;s druid level + her Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect and become immune to it for 24 hours. Though this ability is instantaneous, break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish can reverse the effects.<br /><br />This ability replaces resist nature&rsquo;s lure.<br /><br />Devolution (Sp): At 9th level, a devolutionist can perform a 24-hour ritual to irrevocably transform a humanoid or animal into a devolved feral state. There is no saving throw, but the target must be present and stay relatively still for the entire ritual, which typically requires a willing or restrained target. An affected humanoid&rsquo;s Intelligence score is instantly reduced to 2; its type changes to animal; it loses all spellcasting and abilities that require intelligence; it can&rsquo;t wield manufactured weapons; it gains two claw attacks and a bite attack (all dealing 1d4 points of damage for a Medium humanoid or 1d3 for Small humanoids); and it can&rsquo;t use skills other than Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Intimidate, Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim.<br /><br />An affected animal is undomesticated (see above) if applicable and then either gains the advanced template, except without any increases to mental ability scores, or becomes a dire version of the animal (if a dire version exists and at the GM&rsquo;s discretion). The devolved creature starts out friendly toward the devolutionist, though it typically tries to kill and devour other sentient humanoids. The devolutionist has no special empathy or connection with a creature she devolves, and if it was her animal companion before, it ceases to be so. The druid can communicate her desires to a devolved creature using wild empathy. This ability counters and dispels awaken, and only awaken, miracle, or wish can reverse it.<br /><br />This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Druid","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/leaf-jade-3.jpg","_id":"bMsAt9PnqoPkfenJ"}

By sacrificing the life of a sentient creature, they can generate energy that guarantees fertility and prosperity for lower creatures like plants and animals. These druids preach to flocks who become willing sacrifices, each serving as a &ldquo;king&rdquo; or &ldquo;queen&rdquo; for a short time after being chosen as the next sacrifice.<br /><br />Alignment: In addition to a druid&rsquo;s usual alignment requirements, a life channeler must be of a nongood alignment. If she becomes good, she can no longer take levels in the druid class or fill her wicker talismans (see below), but she otherwise keeps all her abilities.<br /><br />This alters the druid&rsquo;s alignment requirements.<br /><br />Plant Preservation (Su): A life channeler must choose the Plant domain with her nature bond (she can select the Growth subdomain if she wishes). When she performs a coup de grace that kills a sentient humanoid creature (not a summoned creature), she can do so ritualistically in order to affect the area centered on the body with the enrichment version of plant growth. The sacrifice is a death effect.<br /><br />This ability alters nature bond.<br /><br />Wicker Talismans (Su): At 4th level, a life channeler gains a selection of wicker talismans that can store and convert the life energy of sentient creatures into the growth, health, and fertility of plants around her. The life channeler gains one wicker talisman corresponding to each level of druid spells she can cast, starting with 1st-level spells. These talismans are initially empty, but can hold life energy. When the life channeler ritualistically kills a creature with a coup de grace, she can store life energy in a talisman instead of gaining the plant growth effect. The creature must be of a CR equal to at least twice the spell level of the corresponding talisman. For instance, a CR 8 creature&rsquo;s life energy could provide energy for a talisman holding up to a 4th-level spell. A talisman is either full or empty; it can&rsquo;t hold more than one creature&rsquo;s life energy. A life channeler can expend the energy stored in a talisman to cast her domain spell of the talisman&rsquo;s level without expending a spell slot.<br /><br />Starting at 6th level, a life channeler gathers a flock of willing sacrifices. This grants her the benefits of the Leadership feat, except that using a follower as a human sacrifice with this ability doesn&rsquo;t cause the life channeler to take a penalty to her Leadership score.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild shape.<br /><br />Rampant Growth: At 4th level, a life channeler can enrich the land more than usual with her sacrifices. When ritually killing a creature with a coup de grace for the plant growth enrichment effect or casting plant growth for the enrichment effect from one of her talismans, the effect has a range of 1 mile instead of a range of half a mile. At 8th level, if the sacrificed creature was at least CR 8, the effect lasts for 3 years instead of 1 year. At 12th level, if the sacrificed creature was at least CR 12, the effect increases productivity to two-thirds above normal, instead of one-third above normal. These effects stack, assuming the creature is high enough CR.<br /><br />Stored Life: At 9th level, a life channeler gains a third option when using a coup de grace on a sentient humanoid. If the victim had a CR at least as high as the life channeler&rsquo;s class level, the life channeler can store the creature&rsquo;s life energy in her body. She can have the life energy from only 1 creature in her body at a time. While she is storing life energy, if she would take damage or die from a death effect or if she would gain negative levels or take energy drain, she can sacrifice the stored energy to negate the effect without spending an action.<br /><br />This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Druid","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/leaf-jade-3.jpg","_id":"bmNmOw8DlvTrVGuP"}

The druid gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding her animal companion. The pack lord may have more than one animal companion, but she must divide up her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a 4th-level pack lord can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion.<br /><br />Each time a pack lord&rsquo;s druid level increases, she must decide how to allocate the increase among her animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once a druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the pack lord&rsquo;s service (she must release the companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can do the next time she prepares spells).

She can maintain this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and end it as a free action.

Fungal pilgrims are druids seeking transformation into a more plantlike existence. These unique adherents of nature&rsquo;s creed see fungi as the means to such ends, as many fungi&mdash;particularly those of the Darklands&mdash; naturally work their way into the bodies of living creatures.<br /><br />Devotion to Ascension (Ex): A fungal pilgrim must select the Plant domain for her nature bond if she does not select an animal companion.<br /><br />This alters nature bond.<br /><br />Spore Spawning: At 4th level, a fungal pilgrim who selected the Plant domain for her nature bond gains the ability to grow fungal creatures from the spores of her body. Once per day, when casting a summon nature&rsquo;s ally spell to summon a single creature, the fungal pilgrim can infuse her fungal connection into the casting. The creature summoned must be selected from the summon nature&rsquo;s ally list for 1 spell level lower than the spell cast. For example, if the fungal pilgrim casts summon nature&rsquo;s ally III, she must choose a creature from the list in summon nature&rsquo;s ally II.<br /><br />Creatures summoned in this manner gain the fungal creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 116), except they do not gain the create spawn and poison spore cloud special attacks. A creature summoned in this manner cannot be harvested for its poison.<br /><br />A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, it can be used any number of times per day.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild shape if the fungal pilgrim selected the Plant domain as her nature bond.<br /><br />Fungal Companion: At 4th level, a fungal pilgrim who selected an animal companion for her nature bond initiates a transformation in her companion. The animal companion gains the fungal creature template (Bestiary 4 116), but does not gain the create spawn, poison spore cloud, and poisonous blood special attacks. At 10th level, the animal companion gains the poisonous blood special attack. At 14th level, the animal companion gains the poison spore cloud special attack. At 20th level, the animal companion gains the create spawn special attack; created spawn are under the control of the fungal pilgrim. Spawn created in this way last for only 48 hours before rotting away.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild shape if the fungal pilgrim selected an animal companion as her nature bond.<br /><br />Mycological Transformation (Ex): Fungal spores become fully integrated into the druid&rsquo;s body, inside and out. At 15th level, she gains all immunities granted by the plant creature type as well as the light sensitivity universal monster rule. She counts as a plant for the purposes of effects that would negatively affect or damage plants. In addition, she no longer needs to eat or sleep in the typical manner, and instead gains the fungal creature&rsquo;s rejuvenation ability. She can perform her daily meditation during her rejuvenation.<br /><br />This ability replaces timeless body.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Druid","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/leaf-jade-3.jpg","_id":"hIBr0KnBxCvOQ0z3"}

Elemental allies are most common in Qadira, where they are considered similar to genie-binders.<br /><br />Elemental Eidolons: At 1st level, an elemental ally has four elemental eidolons she can summon, one each for the elements of air, earth, fire, and water. Their abilities and statistics are determined using the rules for elemental eidolons for the summoner class from page 33 of Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, as if the elemental ally were a summoner of her druid level, except they gain no additional evolution pool ( just those evolutions from their base form and base evolutions from their subtype).<br /><br />Each of the four elementals has its own base form, skills, and feats. The elemental ally can summon one of these elementals with the same 1-minute ritual a summoner normally uses to do so. The elemental ally can&rsquo;t summon an eidolon or cast summon nature&rsquo;s ally if she currently has an eidolon summoned. She also can&rsquo;t summon an eidolon if she currently has a creature summoned through other means. If one of the elemental ally&rsquo;s eidolons is killed, she cannot summon any eidolons for 24 hours. The elemental ally can dismiss her eidolon as a standard action.<br /><br />As the elemental ally gains levels, her elemental eidolons&rsquo; base statistics and base evolutions increase as if her druid level were her summoner level. The eidolons gain the darkvision, link, share spells, evasion, ability score increase, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion abilities at the appropriate levels, but never gain an evolution pool. Abilities and spells that grant additional evolution points to eidolons do not function for elemental eidolons, though any ability that would grant evolution points to an animal companion does work. The elemental ally does not gain life link or any other class features a summoner gains in relation to her eidolon.<br /><br />This ability replaces nature&rsquo;s bond and wild shape.<br /><br />Elemental Empathy (Ex): An elemental ally can improve the attitude of a creature of the elemental subtype. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The elemental ally rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the elemental empathy check result.<br /><br />To use elemental empathy, the elemental ally and the elemental must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, inf luencing an elemental in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.<br /><br />An elemental ally can also use this ability to influence a non-elemental outsider with the air, earth, fire, or water subtype, but she takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the check.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Elemental Magic: The elemental ally can target elementals (including her elemental eidolons) with any spell she casts that targets animals, even though elementals can&rsquo;t normally be targeted by such spells.<br /><br />Elemental Resistance (Ex): At 4th level, an elemental ally gains resist acid, cold, electricity, and fire 5.
