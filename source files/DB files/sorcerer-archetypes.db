A mongrel mage&rsquo;s bloodline powers can change on a daily basis, but always fall short of those of a full-blooded sorcerer&rsquo;s powers. A mongrel mage is a dabbler in all bloodlines but a master of none, and she is looked down upon by true sorcerers.<br /><br />Mongrel Reservoir (Su): At 1st level, a mongrel mage has an innate pool of magical energy, known as her mongrel reservoir, that she can draw upon to activate her weakened bloodline. Her mongrel reservoir can hold an amount of magical energy equal to 3 + her sorcerer level. Each day when refreshing her spell slots, her mongrel reservoir is restored to full. The mongrel reservoir can never hold more points that the total mentioned above; points gained in excess of this maximum are lost.<br /><br />Each day when she refreshes her spell slots, the mongrel mage selects one sorcerer bloodline. She must select an ordinary bloodline with this ability, not one altered by the wildblooded archetype or any other archetype. She gains this bloodline&rsquo;s 1st-level bloodline power for that day, using it as if she were only a 1st-level sorcerer. (If this ability is used to gain an arcane bond and the bonded item is selected, she can use the item only to cast a 1st-level spell known, as she counts as only a 1st-level sorcerer.) A mongrel mage can have only one bloodline selected at a time.<br /><br />As a swift action, she can expend 1 point from her mongrel reservoir to activate that bloodline, allowing her to use its 1st-level bloodline powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level, including using a bonded item from an arcane bond. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />At 3rd level, when activating her selected bloodline, a mongrel mage can instead spend 2 points from her mongrel reservoir to allow her to use the bloodline&rsquo;s 1st- and 3rd-level powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />At 7th level, when a mongrel mage is activating her selected bloodline, the mongrel mage can instead spend 3 points from her mongrel reservoir, allowing her to use the bloodline&rsquo;s 1st-, 3rd-, and 7th-level powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus.<br /><br />At 20th level, when activating her selected bloodline, a mongrel mage can instead spend 5 points from her mongrel reservoir, allowing her to use all of the bloodline&rsquo;s powers as well as its bloodline arcana at her full sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />This ability alters the bloodline class feature, bloodline powers, and bloodline spells.<br /><br />Bloodline Spells: At 7th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rdlevel spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.<br /><br />At 13th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-level spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.<br /><br />At 19th level, each day when she selects her bloodline, a mongrel mage adds the 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-level spells from her selected bloodline to her current list of spells known.<br /><br />This ability replaces the bloodline feats gained at 7th, 13th, and 19th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Sorcerer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fireball-red-3.jpg","_id":"1asX8LnJdvr8WOns"}

A Razmiran priest has the following class features.<br /><br />False Piety (Ex): At 1st level, a Razmiran priest gains Knowledge (religion) and Perform as class skills, but loses Appraise and Fly as class skills. He adds half his sorcerer level to Use Magic Device checks to activate spell trigger and spell completion items that use divine spells. He gains False Focus as a bonus feat (see page 10).

At 5th level, he adds remove disease to his list of spells known as a 3rd-level spell. This ability replaces the bloodline spells gained at 3rd level and 5th level respectively.<br /><br />Razmiran Channel (Su): At 9th level, the Razmiran priest can use his own magic to power spell completion and spell trigger items that use divine spells. He expends a sorcerer spell slot that is at least 1 level higher than the level of the spell he&rsquo;s trying to activate, then makes a Use Magic Device check. If he succeeds, the item&rsquo;s spell occurs and the item or charge is not expended. If he fails, nothing happens. Whether he succeeds or fail, his spell slot is expended.

For a sorcerer of sleep, the mind-altering drug pesh (see page 19) is the key. The garbled visions the drug provides allow a sorcerer of sleep to reach an ideal state for channeling her arcane power. The arcane and dreamspunAPG bloodlines are the sorcerer heritages most often associated with pesh, though a sorcerer of sleep might exhibit any bloodline; pesh is a tool to enhance her gifts, rather than their source.<br /><br />Pesh Expert: A sorcerer of sleep adds 1/2 her sorcerer level (minimum 1) on Appraise, Craft (alchemy), Heal, and Knowledge (local) checks related to pesh and other drugs. This ability replaces bloodline arcana.<br /><br />Sahir-Afiyun: A sorcerer of sleep gains Sahir-Afiyun (see page 18) as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. A sorcerer of sleep adds Pesh Euphoria, Pesh Healing, Pesh Rejuvenation, and Sahir- Afiyun (see page 18 for these feats) to her list of bloodline feats.

In most cases, sorcerers with this bloodline are the offspring of two sorcerers from different ancestries, but occasionally a crossblooded sorcerer arises from the conjunction of other powers. A draconic sorcerer who is also the culmination of a great destiny, an abyssal sorcerer from a family that dealt with devils, and an arcane sorcerer raised from birth by fey are all possible sources for crossblooded bloodlines.<br /><br />A crossblooded sorcerer selects two different bloodlines. The sorcerer may gain access to the skills, feats, and some of the powers of both bloodlines she is descended from, but at the cost of reduced mental clarity and choice (see Drawbacks).<br /><br />Class Skill: A crossblooded sorcerer receives the bonus class skill from both of her bloodlines. If these are the same skill, this does not grant any additional benefit.<br /><br />Bonus Spells: A crossblooded sorcerer may select her bonus spells from either of her bloodlines. The sorcerer also has the choice to learn a lower-level bonus spell she did not choose in place of the higher-level bonus spell she would normally gain. Lower-level bonus spells learned this way always use the spell level that they would be if the sorcerer had learned them with the appropriate bonus spell.<br /><br />Example: A 3rd-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded sorcerer has the choice of learning cause fear or enlarge person as her bloodline bonus spell. If she selected cause fear as her 3rd-level bonus spell, at 5th level she could use her new bonus spell to learn enlarge person instead of bull&rsquo;s strength or see invisibility, and she would add it to her list of 1st-level spells known (just as if she had learned it as her 3rd-level bonus spell).<br /><br />Bonus Feat: A crossblooded sorcerer combines the bonus feat lists from both of her bloodlines and may select her bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.<br /><br />Bloodline Arcana: A crossblooded sorcerer gains the bloodline arcana of both her bloodlines.<br /><br />Bloodline Powers: At 1st, 3rd, 9th, 15th, and 20th levels, a crossblooded sorcerer gains one of the two new bloodline powers available to her at that level. She may instead select a lower-level bloodline power she did not choose in place of one of these higher-level powers.<br /><br />Drawbacks: A crossblooded sorcerer has one fewer spell known at each level (including cantrips) than is presented on the sorcerer spells known table. Furthermore, the conflicting urges created by the divergent nature of the crossblooded sorcerer&rsquo;s dual heritage forces her to constantly take some mental effort just to remain focused on her current situation and needs. This leaves her with less mental resolve to deal with external threats. A crossblooded sorcerer always takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Will saves.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Sorcerer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fireball-red-3.jpg","_id":"Jgi7y3vMDZNWPH76"}

While most might be content with their strange powers, some oracles and sorcerers join the Pathfinders specifically to find out more about their mysteries and bloodlines and determine the genesis and history of their eldritch talents. These spellcasters are known among the Spells as seekers, after their obsession with researching ancient texts and obscure ruins for any clues they can find about their heritage and histories. A seeker has the following class features. <br /><br />Tinkering (Ex): Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical items in order to learn more about their oracle mysteries or sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and weird, a seeker gains Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also possesses levels in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels stack with his oracle or sorcerer levels for determining his overall bonus on these skill checks. For an oracle, this ability replaces all of the bonus class skills he would otherwise normally gain from his mystery. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces his bonus Eschew Materials feat. <br /><br />Seeker Lore (Ex): By 3rd level, a seeker has already learned much about his mystery or bloodline, and is more comfortable using the bonus spells gained by that mystery or bloodline. He gains a +4 bonus on all concentration checks, on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance, and on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks made on topics associated with his bonus spells. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 3rd level. <br /><br />Seeker Magic (Su): At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his mystery or bloodline spells with metamagic. When a seeker applies a metamagic feat to any bonus spells granted by his mystery or his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat&rsquo;s spell level adjustment by 1. Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only increases the spell&rsquo;s effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not stack with similar reductions from other abilities. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 15th level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 15th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Sorcerer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fireball-red-3.jpg","_id":"aCjFO3xry6I838vo"}

A tattooed sorcerer has the following class features.<br /><br />Familiar Tattoo (Su): A tattooed sorcerer gains a familiar as an arcane bond, as a wizard equal to her sorcerer level. Her sorcerer levels stack with any wizard or witch levels she possesses when determining the powers of her familiar&mdash;this ability does not allow her to have both a familiar and a bonded item.<br /><br />Unlike most familiars, her familiar can transform itself into a tattoo that she carries in her flesh. Transforming into a tattoo or back to normal familiar form is a move action for her familiar. In tattoo form, the familiar looks like a stylized version of itself, but does not count as a creature separate from the tattooed sorcerer. In tattoo form it continues to grant its special familiar ability (Core Rulebook 82), but otherwise has no abilities and can take no actions except to transform from tattoo into creature. A familiar tattoo cannot be erased or dispelled. This ability replaces her 1st-level bloodline power.<br /><br />Varisian Tattoo (Ex): At 1st level, the tattooed sorcerer gains Varisian Tattoo (see the Inner Sea World Guide) as a bonus feat. If she doesn&rsquo;t have Spell Focus, she may choose which school of magic her Varisian Tattoo enhances. This ability replaces her Eschew Materials bonus feat.<br /><br />Bloodline Tattoos (Ex): Whenever a tattooed sorcerer gains a bloodline spell, a new tattoo manifests on her body to represent this spell. Her bloodline spells are always enhanced by her Varisian Tattoo feat, even if they don&rsquo;t match the school to which her Varisian Tattoo belongs.<br /><br />Create Spell Tattoo (Su): At 7th level, a tattooed sorcerer can create a spell tattoo (see page 16) once per day with a single touch as a standard action. The recipient of the spell tattoo must be willing to receive the spell tattoo. If she gives the spell tattoo to herself, it does not count against the regular limit of magic tattoos she can have. The spell tattoo must be of a spell that she knows that has no material or focus component. She can maintain one spell tattoo created by this ability at a time&mdash;if she uses this ability again, the previous spell tattoo she created fades away. Spell tattoos she creates with Inscribe Magic Tattoo do not count against this limit. She can use this ability twice per day at 11th level, and three times per day at 15th level. This ability replaces the bloodline feat gained at 7th level.<br /><br />Enhanced Varisian Tattoo (Su): At 9th level, the tattooed sorcerer can pick any one spell she knows for which she has a Varisian Tattoo feat. This spell must be one that lacks focus components and costly material components. She can now use that spell as a spell-like ability once per day. This spell-like ability is not enhanced by her Varisian Tattoo, but it functions at +2 caster levels above her sorcerer caster level. Whenever she gains a bloodline power at a later date, she may change this spell-like ability to another qualifying spell. This ability replaces the 9th-level bloodline power.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Sorcerer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fireball-red-3.jpg","_id":"bYPSNzEB28BOEtYN"}

She can use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means she cannot replace the feat that is currently fulfilling another feat&rsquo;s prerequisites without also replacing all feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.<br /><br />At 15th level, an eldritch scrapper can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time.

Dragon drinkers have the following class features.<br /><br />Bloodline: A dragon drinker must belong to the draconic bloodline.<br /><br />Bleeding Spells (Su): Whenever a dragon drinker casts a spell that deals damage, the spell deals 1 point of bleed damage per spell level to any creatures of the dragon type damaged. This ability replaces the bloodline arcana ability.<br /><br />Blood Drinking (Su): Starting at first level, a dragon drinker gains the ability to drink dragon blood to alter or augment her spellcasting abilities. See page 18 for information on dragon&rsquo;s blood. For the purposes of harvesting dragon&rsquo;s blood, treat the dragon drinker as though she has Dragoncrafting feat. At 5th level, drinking a vial of dragon&rsquo;s blood is a standard action that provides the dragon drinker with the normal benef its of the item, as well as a +1 bonus to her caster level for purposes of level-dependent spell effects on a single spell cast within 1 minute. At 7th level, a consumed vial of dragon blood also heals 1d8 points of damage instead of the standard 1d4. At 11th level, the alchemical bonus on Fortitude and Ref lex saves granted by the blood increases to +2.<br /><br />In the absence of true dragon&rsquo;s blood, the dragon drinker may tap into the draconic blood flowing through her veins to gain the temporary effects of having consumed dragon&rsquo;s blood. As a free action, she can activate this ability, healing 1d4 points of damage and gaining a +1 resistance bonus on Will and Fortitude saves for 1 round. This action may only be performed once per round, and can be performed a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces the claws bloodline power.<br /><br />Energy Assimilation (Su): At 7th level, when the dragon drinker drinks true dragon&rsquo;s blood from a dragon with a breath weapon that deals a different type of energy damage than her chosen energy type, she may adopt the energy resistance of the blood&rsquo;s source dragon as if it were her selected bloodline. This effect lasts for 1 minute per dose of dragon&rsquo;s blood, after which the dragon drinker&rsquo;s energy resistance reverts back to her normal energy type. This ability replaces the 7th-level bloodline feat.<br /><br />Breath Mimicry (Su): At 13th level, when the dragon drinker drinks true dragon&rsquo;s blood from a dragon with a breath weapon of a shape or energy type different from her own, she may use the shape and energy type of the blood&rsquo;s source dragon when she next uses her breath weapon. This ability replaces the 13th-level bloodline feat.<br /><br />Blood Siphon (Su): At 19th level, when the dragon drinker is within 60 feet of a creature of the dragon type that is suffering bleed damage, she can, as a swift action, draw a dose of its blood into herself as though she had consumed it from a vial. Additionally, when she consumes dragon&rsquo;s blood, it heals 3d8 points of damage and provides a +3 resistance bonus on Fortitude and Will saves for 1 minute in place of its normal effects.

If this reduces the number to 0, she can cast spells of that level only if her Charisma score grants her bonus spells of that level.<br /><br />This ability alters the sorcerer&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Shrouded Spells (Su): An umbral scion is enveloped by wisps of shadow whenever she casts a spell. The DC to identify spells cast by an umbral scion increases by 2. If the spell is being cast within an area of dim light or darkness, the DC increases by 5 instead.<br /><br />Encroaching Darkness (Su): An umbral scion is capable of influencing light around her. As a standard action, she can produce a 10-foot-radius veil centered on a creature or object within 30 feet. This veil decreases the light level by one step and remains for a number of rounds equal to the sorcerer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. At 7th level, the veil increases to a 30-foot radius. At 8th level, the veil decreases the light level by two steps. If the light level is decreased past darkness, the veil is treated as deeper darkness. At 14th level, the veil increases to 60 feet and grants any creature within it cover (even against senses normally able to penetrate total darkness, such as the see in darkness ability). An umbral scion can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This ability replaces the shadowstrike bloodline power.<br /><br />Potent Shadows (Su): At 7th level, when an umbral scion casts a spell of the shadow subschool or a spell with the darkness or shadowUM descriptor within an area of dim light or darkness, she treats her caster level as 1 higher.

These sorcerers are most common among dwarves, but have been known to appear among other races who have strong ties to earth, rock, stone, mountains, and the Darklands.<br /><br />Blood of the Earth: Stone warders must have a bloodline with strong ties to earth and rock. A stone warder must select the deep earthAPG, draconic (copper dragon only), elemental (earth only), orc (Pathfinder Player Companion: Orcs of Golarion 14), or shaitanUM bloodline.<br /><br />Power of Stone (Su): A stone warder draws power from natural rock, and gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when in hills, mountains, or underground terrain. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level, and by an additional 1 every 5 sorcerer levels thereafter. However, this strong elemental tie prevents a stone warder from casting spells that have the air, cold, electricity, fire, or water descriptor.<br /><br />Rune of Warding (Sp): As a standard action, a stone warder can create a warding rune in any adjacent square. The stone warder selects a sorcerer spell known that is at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast, and casts it as part of creating the rune of warding. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less, and it must target one or more creatures. Rather than have its normal effect, the spell is stored in the rune. The first creature to enter the square triggers the rune of warding, and becomes the target of the selected spell. Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it affects only the creature that triggers the rune.<br /><br />The rune is invisible and lasts a number of rounds equal to the stone warder&rsquo;s level or until discharged. If placed on a solid rock or stone surface, it instead lasts 1 minute per sorcerer level the stone warder has or until discharged. The stone warder cannot create a rune of warding in a square occupied by an existing rune of warding or another creature. The rune counts as a spell of the same level as the spell stored within it for the purposes of dispelling. It is considered a magic trap and can be discovered with a successful Perception check (DC = 25 + the level of the stored spell) and disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (DC = 25 + the level of the stored spell). The stone warder can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This ability replaces Eschew Materials, the bloodline spell gained at 3rd level, and the bloodline feat gained at 7th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Sorcerer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fireball-red-3.jpg","_id":"r9HCheZRm3QQ4PZk"}

However, like the genies they are descended from, wishcrafters can only draw upon this power to fulfill the desires of others. A wishcrafter has the following class features.<br /><br />Wishbound Arcana (Su): At 1st level, the wishcrafter can use the wishes of non-genie creatures other than herself in place of the normal verbal components of her spells. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the wishcrafter&rsquo;s turn. The wishcrafter must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn&rsquo;t normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn&rsquo;t need to mention the name of a specific spell, but must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the wishcrafter knows (for example, wishing to be bigger could supply the verbal component for enlarge person). A wishcrafter gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature&rsquo;s wish as a verbal component in this manner, but cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than a target or targets. A wishcrafter is under no compulsion to grant a creature&rsquo;s wish. Once the wishcrafter grants a creature&rsquo;s wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours. This ability replaces bloodline arcana.<br /><br />Expanded Wishcraft: At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the wishcrafter grows more adept at altering reality to fit the whims of others. She may add an additional spell selected from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her list of spells known. This spell must be one level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. A wishcrafter can only use these spells in conjunction with her wishbound arcana ability. For example, if she used this ability to learn cat&rsquo;s grace, she can only cast it when another creature wishes for it, and can&rsquo;t cast it on herself because it is a targeted spell. She cannot use these spells to craft or recharge magic items. These bonus spells replace the bloodline spells gained by the sorcerer&rsquo;s bloodline.<br /><br />Heart&rsquo;s Desire (Su): At 7th level, as a swift action, a wishcrafter can force a single creature within 30 feet to confess its deepest desire. The target receives a Will save to negate this effect (DC 10 + 1/2 the wishcrafter&rsquo;s level + the wishcrafter&rsquo;s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the creature must immediately wish aloud in a clear voice for something it truly desires, allowing the wishcrafter to activate her wishbound arcana ability if she knows a spell that can fulfill that wish. This is a mind-affecting effect. Regardless of whether the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of the same wishcrafter&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire ability again for 24 hours. The wishcrafter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 7th level.<br /><br />Twisted Wish (Su): At 13th level, a wishcrafter becomes adept at corrupting wishes to negatively affect the creature that wished them. When a wishcrafter affects a creature with a spell using its wish as a spell component, she may twist the wish, applying a &ndash;4 penalty to the creature&rsquo;s saving throws against the spell. The effects of wishes twisted this way are difficult to remove; the DC of caster level checks to dispel them increases by 5. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 13th level.<br /><br />Perfect Wishcraft (Su): At 19th level, the wishcrafter perfects her ability to manipulate reality. Once per day, she may cast any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were on her list of spells known. Using this ability otherwise has all of the benefits and limitations of the wishbound arcana ability. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 19th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Sorcerer","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fireball-red-3.jpg","_id":"rvBISbM3vXCRIWYY"}
