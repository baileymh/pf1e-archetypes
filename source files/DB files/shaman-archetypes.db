Such overseers may assume roles as religious leaders and protectors of their tribes, turning foes into short-term allies for the tribe&rsquo;s greater good. Other overseers become tyrants who enforce their will upon the weak for personal gain. In combat, an overseer manages the battlefield by debilitating foes using her hexes and specialized spells.<br /><br />Controlling Magic (Su): The overseer adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: charm person (1st), hideous laughter (2nd), hold person (3rd), crushing despair (4th), feeblemind (5th), mass suggestion (6th), power word blind (7th), irresistible dance (8th), and dominate monster (9th).<br /><br />This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&rsquo;s spirit.<br /><br />Spirit Surge (Ex): At 3rd level, an overseer gains the ability to cast any of her mind-affecting spells that target a single creature through her spirit animal. When she&rsquo;s using this ability, the selected spell&rsquo;s range becomes touch, and she must deliver the spell through the spirit animal via the spirit animal&rsquo;s deliver touch spells supernatural ability.

They are scholars of ancient mysteries and keepers of forbidden secrets who go beyond simply learning eldritch traditions to make the occult a part of their very souls.<br /><br />Class Skills: A true silvered throne adds all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, and Sense Motive to his list of class skills, but loses Handle Animal and Survival as class skills. This alters the shaman&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Occult Grimoire (Ex): A true silvered throne&rsquo;s divine magic arises from communion with spirits alongside study of archaic lore compiled into a personal occult grimoire. Unlike a wizard&rsquo;s spellbook, this grimoire doesn&rsquo;t contain specific spells. By studying his grimoire, a true silvered throne can prepare any spell on the shaman spell list or provided by his spirit. If this grimoire is lost or destroyed, he cannot prepare new spells or use his spirit magic class feature until it is replaced, which requires 1 week of work. This ability replaces spirit animal.<br /><br />Ritual Hex: A true silvered throne gains Ritual Hex (see page 24) as a bonus feat.<br /><br />Scarab of the Second Throne (Ex): At 4th level, a true silvered throne successfully constructs a golden scarab that is infused with some of his occult potential. Treat this construct as a clockwork spy (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 58), except it has half its master&rsquo;s total hit points regardless of its Hit Dice and can write and take dictation rather than record audio. If worn in the true silvered throne&rsquo;s amulet slot, the golden scarab provides a +4 bonus to AC against sneak attacks and attacks of opportunity, as the scarab animates and moves to intercept attacks. If lost or destroyed, the golden scarab can be replaced in a week-long ritual costing 250 gp.<br /><br />Wandering Ritual (Su): At 6th level, a true silvered throne can attempt to coax a nearby spirit into service with a 1-minute-long ritual once per day, gaining that spirit&rsquo;s spirit ability and adding its list of spells to those he can cast using his spirit magic. The silvered throne can maintain this bond for 1 hour, or until he dismisses the spirit as a free action. At 12th level, he also gains this spirit&rsquo;s greater spirit power while bonded, and at 20th level gains its true spirit power as well. He can perform a wandering ritual one additional time per day at 8th level and 14th level. This ability replaces wandering spirit and wandering hex.<br /><br />Esoteric Rites (Ex): At 8th level, a true silvered throne gains a +1 insight bonus on skill checks attempted as part of an occult ritual. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 shaman levels beyond 8th (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the true silvered throne is the ritual&rsquo;s primary caster, he also adds this bonus to the caster level of the ritual&rsquo;s effect.

This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Laugh at Death (Su): At 10th level, the spirit warden&rsquo;s familiarity with the dead has filled her with contempt for death itself.

Spirits that linger in areas where primal magic reigns can become warped, losing touch with their former selves and experiencing random surges of power. A shaman who communes with such spirits learns to stabilize these erratic energies and draw upon them to her benefit. Such shamans gradually learn to guide their spirits toward coherence and lucidity, and in the process learn to bend chance and fortune in their favor.<br /><br />Spirit Animal: A primal warden&rsquo;s spirit animal exhibits unusual physical features for a creature of its type, such as unnatural colorations and extra or missing appendages. Each day, the spirit animal gains resistance 10 against a random element. Roll 1d4 to determine the type of resistance (1 = acid, 2 = cold, 3 = electricity, 4 = fire).<br /><br />This replaces the abilities the shaman&rsquo;s spirit animal gains from the shaman&rsquo;s chosen spirit.<br /><br />Unstable Spellcasting: A primal warden&rsquo;s spirit is ever shifting, and the spells it grants the primal warden change from moment to moment.<br /><br />When the primal warden would spontaneously cast a 1st-through- 8th-level spell using the spirit magic class feature, she produces a random spell from the list of shaman spells on page 48 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide of 1 spell level higher than the spell slot expended; use an appropriate die or another randomization method to determine the spell. When she would spontaneously cast a 9th-level spell using spirit magic, she instead casts a random 9th-level spell from the shaman spell list in the Advanced Class Guide, treating her caster level as 2 higher. There is no way to predict the spell before the shaman begins casting it using spirit magic, and she cannot enhance the spell using metamagic feats. The spell uses the shaman&rsquo;s caster level, even if that caster level would normally be too low to cast the spell. There are 47 potential 2nd-level spells, 46 potential 3rd-level spells, 41 potential 4th-level spells, 30 potential 5th-level spells, 22 potential 6th-level spells, 22 potential 7th-level spells, 18 potential 8th-level spells, and 14 potential 9th-level spells.<br /><br />At 8th level, after determining the spell that she would cast using spirit magic, once per day as a free action, the primal warden shaman can choose to randomly select another spell instead, using the same method of randomization as she used before (if she obtains the same result a second time, she must keep that result). At 12th level and every 4 shaman levels thereafter, she can choose to randomly select a different spirit magic spell one additional time per day, up to a maximum of four times per day at 20th level. She cannot use this ability more than once in the same round.<br /><br />This alters spirit magic and replaces the hex gained at 8th level.<br /><br />Hexes: A primal warden shaman gains the hexes below at the specified levels.<br /><br />A primal warden shaman cannot select the chant hex, the evil eye hex, the misfortune hex, or any witch hexes. This alters hexes and replaces the hexes gained at 4th and 12th levels.<br /><br />Primal Blessing (Su): At 4th level, the shaman gains the ability to channel primal magic into a target within 30 feet. Roll 1d4 to determine the effect. On a result of 1, the target takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. On a result of 2, the target&rsquo;s size is enlarged or reduced, as per enlarge person or reduce person, and the effect functions even if the target is not a humanoid; roll randomly to determine the effect. On a result of 3, the target gains a +20-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed. On a result of 4, all attacks against the target suffer a 20% miss chance. The effects of this hex last for 1 minute. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.<br /><br />Greater Primal Blessing (Su): At 12th level, the shaman&rsquo;s primal blessing hex improves. This functions as the primal blessing hex in all ways, except that the shaman has a chance to bestow greater benefits upon her targets. Roll 1d6 to determine the effect. On a result of 1&ndash;4, refer to the primal blessing ability to determine the effect. On a roll of 5, the target gains a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls and saving throws and to her Armor Class. On a roll of 6, the target gains the benefit of the haste spell, using the primal warden&rsquo;s shaman level as her caster level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shaman","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","_id":"NfnVsJVlAX51M2Z6"}

They revere plant life in all its forms, with a special fondness for poisonous or carnivorous plants. Unlike most shamans, a grasping vine is guided by a plantlike creature rather than a spirit animal.<br /><br />Spirit: Though a grasping vine is not limited to a particular choice of spirit, common selections are Life, Nature, or Wood (Pathfinder Player Companion Heroes of the Wild 26).<br /><br />Plant Spirit (Ex): A shaman&rsquo;s spirit animal is made of leaves and thorny vines. This plant spirit has the statistics and abilities as a shaman&rsquo;s spirit animal, but it is treated as a creature of the plant type rather than a native outsider.<br /><br />This ability alters the shaman&rsquo;s spirit animal.<br /><br />Verdant Magic: A grasping vine adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: entangle (1st), barkskin (2nd), thorny entanglementACG (3rd), command plants (4th), wall of thorns (5th), fire seeds (6th), animate plants (7th), horrid wilting (8th), and shambler (9th).<br /><br />This ability replaces the spirit magic spells granted by the shaman&rsquo;s spirit.<br /><br />Greentongue (Sp): At 2nd level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can use speak with plants as a spell-like ability. The grasping vine can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her shaman level. In addition, while under the effects of speak with plants, the grasping vine can deliver a suggestion (as per the spell) to a single plant creature within 30 feet, ignoring the plant&rsquo;s immunity to mind-affecting effects. The grasping vine can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels after 2nd level.<br /><br />This ability replaces the shaman&rsquo;s hex gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Flower&rsquo;s Form (Sp): At 8th level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant creature, as per plant shape I. At 12th level, this ability functions as plant shape II. At 16th level, this ability functions as plant shape III. The grasping vine can use this ability for 1 minute per shaman level per day.

The animist perceives that all things have a spirit, including objects, constructs, illnesses, buildings, and the environment.<br /><br />Animist Spirit Magic: The animist adds the following spells to the list of spells he can cast using spirit magic: speak with animals (1st), skinsendUM (2nd), speak with plants (3rd), malfunctionUM (4th), dream (5th), speak with stone (6th), control constructUM (7th), trap the soul (8th), soul bind (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&rsquo;s spirit.<br /><br />Wrangle Condition (Su): At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.<br /><br />The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition&rsquo;s spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured.<br /><br />Minor Conditions (DC 15): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.<br />Major Conditions (DC 20): Dazed and staggered.<br />Severe Conditions (DC 25): Exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.<br />Dire Conditions (DC 30): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.<br /><br />The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.<br /><br />At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.<br /><br />This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Exorcism (Su): At 8th level, the animist can attempt to end effects that control a creature or object, such as magic jar, possess objectUM, dominate person, and dominate monster, or possessing entities such as ghosts. This is a full-round action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman level + her Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist&rsquo;s exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.<br /><br />Dominate Spirit (Sp): At 10th level, the animist can attempt to possess creatures or objects as magic jar or possess objectUM. When the animist is attempting to possess the creature, his familiar acts as the jar and must be within 10 feet when the animist attempts to possess a creature. The animist&rsquo;s soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar&rsquo;s senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist&rsquo;s soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.<br /><br />Contact with the Spirit World (Su): At 12th level, the shaman can interact with incorporeal entities as if his unarmed strikes and melee weapons had the ghost touch weapon special ability. While using this ability, he can also see nearby ethereal entities and likewise strike at them as if they were incorporeal. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his shaman level. The rounds need not be consecutive.

A benefactor can&rsquo;t use spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items that use shaman spells with the curse descriptor unless she succeeds at a Use Magic Device check.<br /><br />This alters the shaman&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Benefactor Hexes: A benefactor adds the following hexes to the list of shaman hexes she can choose from whenever she gains a new hex or a wandering hex. A benefactor cannot gain a hex that is a curse effect or that has the word &ldquo;curse&rdquo; in its name as a hex or a wandering hex.<br /><br />This ability alters hexes.<br /><br />Boon Reservoir (Su): Once per day, a benefactor can perform a 10-minute ritual with one of her allies, plus one additional ally for every 3 shaman levels she has. All creatures that participate in the ritual (including the benefactor) gain a boon reservoir with a number of points equal to 1/2 the benefactor&rsquo;s shaman level (minimum 1) for 24 hours. As an immediate action, a creature can spend 1 point from its boon reservoir to gain a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws it attempts until the start of its next turn. Boon reservoir points that are not spent within 24 hours are wasted. <br /><br />Expanded Boon (Su): When a benefactor gains this hex, she chooses one of the following: ability checks, attack rolls, or skill checks. Instead of gaining an insight bonus on saving throws, any creature with a boon reservoir granted by the benefactor can spend 1 point as an immediate action to gain a +2 insight bonus on rolls or checks of the chosen kind until the start of its next turn. This hex can be chosen multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different roll or check. A benefactor must have the boon reservoir hex before choosing this hex.<br /><br />Suppress Curse (Sp): As a standard action, a benefactor can attempt to suppress one curse effect that is affecting a creature or object with a touch. This functions as per remove curse, except the curse&rsquo;s effects are suppressed for 1 hour, even if it is a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor. This allows a creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove or get rid of it.

Instead, she invites the spirits to share her body, granting them the chance to experience corporeal existence. In return, they grant her their skills and protect her from otherworldly influence.<br /><br />Shared Skill (Su): At 1st level, a possessed shaman selects two skills. Both of these skills must use the same ability score. The possessed shaman treats these skills as if she had a number of ranks in them equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skills would normally use. If either of the skills are class skills, she receives the usual +3 bonus on those skill checks for having ranks in those skills.

The possessed shaman treats this skill as if she had a number of ranks in it equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skill would normally use. If the skill is a class skill, she receives the usual +3 bonus on skill checks for having ranks in that skill.

Originally started as a humble memorial, the Wall of Names is now a moving testament to all those who have given their lives to further the cause of the Pathfinder Society, and for many agents, an expedition to Absalom is as much a chance to visit the Wall of Names and seek out a vanished loved one, relation, or departed friend as it is an opportunity to visit the place where it all began.<br /><br />A decade ago, a small cadre of agents began studying the fallen names, correlating these adventurers with the quests they were on when they perished or went missing, and then took it upon themselves to finish these incomplete missions&mdash; but in so doing these agents made an unexpected discovery. In delving into the storied histories etched into the Wall of Names, these agents have discovered how to commune with the departed spirits of those whose names are memorialized on the monument. These mystical agents soon became known as name-keepers, and they pride themselves on helping their predecessors find peace while preventing other Pathfinders&rsquo; names from being added to the wall.<br /><br />Class Skills: A name-keeper gains Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge (history), and Linguistics as class skills, instead of Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (planes), and Survival.<br /><br />This alters the shaman&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Inherited Wayfinder (Su): A name-keeper forms a powerful bond with a damaged wayfinder (see pages 148&ndash;149) inherited from another Pathfinder. It functions for her alone. This functions as a wizard&rsquo;s bonded object except it can be used to cast shaman spells (instead of wizard spells).<br /><br />This ability replaces spirit animal.<br /><br />Keeper Spirit Magic: The namekeeper adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: stone shieldARG (1st), object readingOA (2nd), speak with dead (3rd), wall of stone (4th), breath of life (5th), stone tell (6th), vision (7th), word of recall (8th), and true resurrection (9th).<br /><br />This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&rsquo;s spirit.<br /><br />Pathfinders Past (Su): At 4th level, a name-keeper can form a temporary bond with a deceased Pathfinder who is commemorated on the Wall of Names. The namekeeper must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains one or more benefits tied to the Pathfinder&rsquo;s former focus in the Society: Scrolls, Spells, or Swords. Each allows her to select one or more options (such as a weapon or shaman spirit), and she can choose different options each time she forms this bond.<br /><br />Scrolls: The name-keeper selects an oracleAPG mystery. She can use any of the mystery&rsquo;s associated skills untrained, and she treats them as class skills. For any of those skills that were already class skills, she instead gains a +2 sacred bonus on those checks. At 12th level, she gains Skill Focus for one of the associated skills as a bonus feat. At 20th level, she gains Skill Focus a second time as a bonus feat, and she always counts as having at least 10 ranks in those skills for calculating these temporary feats&rsquo; benefits.<br /><br />Spells: The name-keeper selects a second shaman spirit and adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She gains one additional spirit magic spell slot of her highest spell level. At 12th level, she selects two shaman spirits and adds both their granted spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic. At 20th level, her number of spirit magic spell slots at each spell level increases to two.<br /><br />Swords: The name-keeper gains proficiency in all martial weapons and one exotic weapon of her choice. At 12th level, whenever she makes a full attack, she gains one additional attack at her highest base attack bonus; this ability stacks with the extra attack from haste, but it doesn&rsquo;t stack with other abilities that grant extra attacks. At 20th level, she gains two combat feats for which she qualifies.<br /><br />This ability replaces wandering spirit.<br /><br />Versatile Hex (Su): At 6th level, a namekeeper can temporarily gain a shaman hex or one of the hexes that her spirit has when she prepares her spells, lasting until the next time she prepares spells. At 14th level, she can select two such hexes each day.<br /><br />This ability replaces wandering hex.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shaman","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","_id":"lJnqRdGNFQ7QbENH"}

She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells for the day. Until she changes the minor spirit, she continues to have access to the shaman or witch hex. At 2nd level, she can instead select a hex from one of her wandering spirits selected for that day.

The serendipitous, shamanistic rites associated with this faith focus upon attracting good fortune and banishing ill fortune in the name of these spirits. Although the ancient practices of the serendipity shaman were once exclusive to the mysterious catfolk nation, the catfolk&rsquo;s curiosity and willingness to travel have spread them across Golarion, where today many with a tendency toward good fortune embrace the faith.<br /><br />Limited Calling: A shaman must have a racial trait with &ldquo;luck&rdquo; in its name to select this archetype, such as cat&rsquo;s luck or half ling luck.

When she gains the wandering spirit class feature, she can select one of these hexes in place of a wandering hex.<br /><br />Channel Luck (Su): A serendipity shaman gains the ability to channel luck, as the cleric variant channeling ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 30), using her shaman level to determine her effective cleric level for the purpose of her channel energy ability. She does not count as having the channel energy ability for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites or prestige class requirements with the exception of Selective Channeling, which the shaman can take as normal.

The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the target hits the shaman with an attack.<br /><br />Spirit Magic: A serendipity shaman adds both her spirit&rsquo;s spirit magic spells and the domain spells from the Luck cleric domain to the list of spells she can cast with the spirit magic ability. This hex cannot be taken as a wandering hex.<br /><br />Tweak the Odds (Su): Whenever the serendipity shaman or one of her allies within 30 feet rolls an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, the shaman can use this ability as an immediate action to tweak the odds in her favor, increasing the result of the die roll or check by 1. This can turn a normal hit into a critical threat, but it cannot make an attack roll an automatic hit (this bonus does not stack with effects that increase a weapon&rsquo;s critical threat range, such as Improved Critical or keen edge). The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her shaman level. At 4th level and every 4 shaman levels thereafter, she can spend an additional use of this ability to further increase the die result of the target&rsquo;s roll by an additional 1.

Some say that the first deep shamans served Besmara back when she was a water spirit, before she achieved full godhood.<br /><br />Deep Spirit: A deep shaman must choose the waves spirit. The deep shaman must choose a spirit animal with the aquatic subtype, and it gains the amphibious special quality instead of gaining the ability to breathe in water. A deep shaman gains Swim as a class skill.<br /><br />This alters spirit, spirit animal, and the shaman&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Aquatic Hexes (Su): When a deep shaman uses beckoning chill on a creature in the water, that creature becomes fatigued due to hypothermia for the duration, and it also becomes entangled if the creature takes damage from he deep shaman&rsquo;s spirit abilities and from spells and abilities with the water descriptor. Her crashing waves hex applies to her spirit abilities that deal damage as if they were spells with the water descriptor, raising her effective shaman level for those abilities. Instead of mist&rsquo;s shroud and watersight, she can select the two hexes below.<br /><br />This alters hexes.<br /><br />Buoyancy Control (Sp): The deep shaman touches a willing creature and changes its buoyancy (see page 43) to whichever of the five states she wishes for 1 minute. A creature affected by this hex can&rsquo;t be affected by it again for 24 hours. The deep shaman has neutral buoyancy, regardless of what her normal buoyancy would be, though she can end or resume the effect as a standard action.<br /><br />Deep Heart (Su): The deep shaman gains the ability to breathe underwater and gains a swim speed equal to her unmodified base land speed. At 8th level, she takes only half the normal amount of pressure damage and she adjusts to a new pressure all at once after succeeding at five Fortitude saves, rather than 100 feet at a time (see Pressure on page 48).<br /><br />Aquatic Spirit Abilities (Su): When used underwater, a deep shaman&rsquo;s wave strike deals lethal bludgeoning damage and pushes the target away 5 feet + an additional 5 feet for every 6 shaman levels she has. At 11th level, whenever the deep shaman is underwater, all weapons she holds are treated as if they had the impact special ability instead of quenching. Instead of a swim speed and the ability to breathe underwater, fluid mastery provides tremorsense with a range of 30 feet while in the water, and when underwater, fluid mastery&rsquo;s torrent deals 1d6 points of damage per shaman level in a 30-foot cone. <br /><br />This alters spirit ability and greater spirit ability.<br /><br />Brine Dragon Form (Su): When a deep shaman gains access to the true version of the waves spirit, she can assume the form of a Large (or smaller) brine dragon as per form of the dragon II, with a line of acid breath weapon, acid resistance 20, and a swim speed of 60 feet. She can use this ability for 1 hour per shaman level each day, divided any way she chooses in 1 hour increments, though the spell&rsquo;s breath weapon limit applies across the whole day. Time she spends underwater doesn&rsquo;t count against this limit, but every minute (or fraction thereof ) that she spends flying expends 1 hour of her daily uses. At 18th level, she can assume the form of a Huge or smaller brine dragon as per form of the dragon III instead.<br /><br />This ability replaces the elemental form of the true spirit ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shaman","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","_id":"uwtt9Xkgkcd8v6aJ"}

Some of these shamans draw their powers from the might of dragons, rather than from spirits. These shamans each gain a powerful drake as an ally, and view caring for that drake as a sacred duty. <br /><br />Drake Companion : A draconic shaman gains a drake companion instead of a spirit animal, and she communes with the drake to prepare her spells just as other shamans commune with their spirit animals. She doesn&rsquo;t gain a primary spirit, but she still gains wandering spirit at 4th level. She must select all her hexes (other than her wandering hexes) from the list of shaman hexes, and she can&rsquo;t select the witch hex shaman hex. She doesn&rsquo;t gain spirit magic slots until 4th level when she gains her wandering spirit. Any ability granted by a wandering spirit that would normally affect a spirit animal (such as nature&rsquo;s true spirit ability) has no effect for a draconic shaman. <br /><br />This ability replaces spirit, spirit animal, and the hexes gained at 4th and 10th levels and alters spirit magic.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shaman","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","_id":"xfJetb413KguGsWY"}

A crystal tender focuses on the spirits of metal and stone, using crystals as a means to focus the power of the spirits she venerates. Many crystal tenders take it upon themselves to guard rich gem veins and other mineral treasures from those who would mine them out of greed, much in the way that surface-dwelling druids might defend a sacred grove from woodcutters.<br /><br />The crystal tenders of Orv meditate within the Crystal Womb, often near the churning vortex that makes up the heart of the Vault. They learn to focus the cavern&rsquo;s energies through ley lines in the stone, and they study the birth of crystals within the Womb in order to mimic the process.<br /><br />Scion of the Stones (Ex): A crystal tender forms a mystic connection with the precious stones and gems she has sworn to protect. Her spirit animal always appears to be composed of a crystalline substance and gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor. Her spirit animal is treated as an outsider with both the earth and native subtypes, and counts as a crystalline creature for the purposes of spells and abilities. The unique nature of her spirit animal increases the cost of replacing it to 750 gp per shaman level.<br /><br />This alters spirit animal.<br /><br />Reciprocal Resonance (Su): At 4th level, a crystal tender learns to form a temporary bond with a spirit of crystal. When selecting her wandering spirit, she can forgo gaining a spirit ability to instead grant herself and her spirit animal DR 1/adamantine as long as they&rsquo;re within 10 feet of one another. While benefiting from this ability, the crystal tender&rsquo;s skin takes on a crystalline sheen. The DR gained from this ability increases to 2/ adamantine at 8th level, 3/adamantine at 12th level, 4/adamantine at 16th level, and 5/adamantine at 20th level.<br /><br />This alters wandering spirit.<br /><br />Invoke Latent Facets (Su): At 8th level, both a crystal tender and her spirit animal gain all of the benefits of any ioun stones worn by one another, as long as they&rsquo;re within 100 feet of each other. The crystal tender&rsquo;s spirit animal can also embed a number of ioun stones equal to the crystal tender&rsquo;s Charisma modifier into its crystalline form. Embedded ioun stones don&rsquo;t gain any additional abilities, save that they don&rsquo;t orbit the spirit animal and can&rsquo;t be separately targeted. A slain or unconscious spirit animal immediately loses all embedded ioun stones, which tumble to the ground beside its body.<br /><br />This replaces the shaman hex gained at 8th level.<br /><br />Cabochon Form (Sp): At 20th level, as a standard action, a crystal tender can transform her body into a living gemstone as per iron body with a duration of 12 hours. Instead of being vulnerable to effects that can harm an iron golem while in this form, she is vulnerable to effects that can harm a crystalline creature (such as shatter). She can use this ability once per day.<br /><br />This replaces manifestation.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shaman","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","_id":"yS9N0s6zj99fDFJA"}

This ability tells the visionary what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the shaman&rsquo;s level + the shaman&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier). A creature affected by this ability cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. This ability functions through magical sensors as with clairaudience/clairvoyance and scrying. This ability replaces wandering spirit gained at 4th level.<br /><br />Vision Spirit Magic: At 4th level, the visionary adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: see alignmentUC (1st), see invisibility (2nd), clairaudience/clairvoyance (3rd), detect scrying (4th), prying eyes (5th), legend lore (6th), vision (7th), moment of prescience (8th), foresight (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman&rsquo;s wandering spirit.<br /><br />Improved Divination (Su): At 6th level, the visionary becomes more adept at divination magic. When she casts the augury spell, her chance for an accurate answer is automatically the maximum of 90%. Likewise, when she casts divination, she has the maximum 90% chance of an accurate answer.<br /><br />Finally, the visionary can prepare scrying as a 4th-level spell, and it requires only 1 minute to cast. The visionary also has a 10% chance per caster level to cast the spells listed in the scrying spell description, instead of 5% per caster level (to a maximum of 100%).<br /><br />The visionary must still prepare these spells to receive these benefits. This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Wandering Spirit (Su): At 12th level, the visionary forms a temporary bond with another spirit (other than the one she selected using her spirit class feature). This is identical to the 4th-level shaman class feature. This adds the wandering spirit magic spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic, along with vision spirit magic and her original spirit. At 20th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. This ability replaces the greater version of wandering spirit gained at 12th level and true version of wandering spirit gained at 20th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Shaman","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","_id":"yrY46j2xKzyfUEYK"}
