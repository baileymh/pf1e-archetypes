As a standard action, the ranger can grant a single weapon he holds the&nbsp;flaming&nbsp;special ability for 1 minute; while under this effect, the weapon counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A flamewarden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier. At 12th level, weapons affected by this ability gain the&nbsp;flaming burst&nbsp;special ability instead.<br /><br />This replaces hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Spells: A flamewarden can prepare spells from the druid list that have the fire descriptor.<br /><br />This alters the ranger&rsquo;s spells.<br /><br />Stoking the Embers (Sp): At 9th level, a flamewarden can fan the last spark of a recently slain creature&rsquo;s life force back into a full flame. Once per day as a standard action, a flamewarden can touch the corpse of a creature that has died within 1 round to grant it the effects of&nbsp;breath of life. This replaces evasion.<br /><br />Burning Renewal (Su): At 12th level, a flamewarden can use the cleansing power of fire to remove afflictions from his body, mind, and soul. When the flamewarden takes 5 or more points of fire damage, he can remove one of the following conditions: fatigued, shaken, or sickened. Alternatively, he can remove 1 point of ability damage or drain from an ability score of his choice.<br /><br />If the flamewarden takes 10 or more points of fire damage, he can remove one of the following conditions: exhausted, frightened, or nauseated. Alternatively, he can remove 1d6 points of ability damage or drain from an ability score of his choice.<br /><br />The ranger can use this ability only once each time he takes fire damage, regardless of how much damage it deals over the required amount. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />If the flamewarden has fire resistance or immunity to fire, fire damage he would have otherwise taken still counts toward activating burning renewal.<br /><br />This replaces camouflage.<br /><br />Phoenix Rising (Su): At 16th level, if a flamewarden dies, his body explodes in a conflagration in a 20-foot spread. Each hostile creature in the area takes 10d6 points of fire damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the ranger&rsquo;s level + his Constitution modifier) for half damage. The flames don&rsquo;t harm the flamewarden&rsquo;s allies, who instead are healed 5d6 points of damage, and any poisons they are currently suffering are neutralized as per&nbsp;neutralize poison. The flamewarden&rsquo;s body is reduced to ashes by the explosion.<br /><br />At 20th level, the flamewarden gains immunity to fire, and once per week, the flamewarden rises from the ashes of his own destruction 1 round after dying. The flamewarden&rsquo;s body re-forms with all his equipment, and he returns to life with half his maximum hit points. Any ability scores that were 0 become 1, and nonmagical diseases and poisons are cured. A&nbsp;limited wish,&nbsp;miracle, or&nbsp;wish&nbsp;spell cast before he rises from the ashes prevents him from doing so, as does the area of an&nbsp;unhallow&nbsp;effect.<br /><br />This replaces improved evasion and master hunter.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"1ceQD8CqMkEaIlax"}

This archetype is available to kasathas (and to other races with four or more arms at the GM&rsquo;s discretion).<br /><br />Twin Bows (Ex): At 1st level, a bow nomad can simultaneously wield a combination of two of any of the following ranged weapons: shortbow, longbow, and their composite versions. When a bow nomad makes a full attack with two bows, twoweapon penalties apply and can be offset with Two- Weapon Fighting feats. Since bows aren&rsquo;t light weapons, a bow nomad with Two-Weapon Fighting takes a &ndash;4 penalty on attacks with each of her bows. Extra attacks from other sources, such as those granted by Manyshot or Rapid Shot, can be applied to only one of the wielded bows per round. This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Combat Style (Ex): At 2nd level, a bow nomad must select archery as her combat style.<br /><br />Agile Maneuvers: At 3rd level, a bow nomad gains Agile Maneuvers as a bonus feat. This replaces Endurance.<br /><br />Trick Shot (Ex): A bow nomad can make a number of trick shots per day equal to 1/2 her ranger level + her Dexterity modifier. Unless otherwise noted, making a trick shot is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.<br /><br />Deflecting Arrow: At 3rd level, as an immediate action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity, a bow nomad can deflect a single ranged attack. This ability functions as the Deflect Arrows feat, except the bow nomad need not have a hand free and can def lect an attack targeting any creature within 30 feet.<br /><br />Hampering Strike: At 8th level, a bow nomad can attempt to disarm or trip an opponent within 30 feet in place of a ranged attack, with a &ndash;4 penalty on the combat maneuver check.<br /><br />Pinning Strike: At 13th level, a bow nomad can attempt to pin a Large or smaller opponent&rsquo;s limb or clothing to the ground or a wall in place of an attack. If the bow nomad&rsquo;s attack roll exceeds her opponent&rsquo;s CMD, the opponent is pinned and cannot move from its current position. As a move action, the opponent can attempt a Strength check to free itself (DC = 10 + 1/2 the bow nomad&rsquo;s ranger level + her Strength modifier). Only creatures adjacent to a solid, anchored, penetrable surface can be affected by this ability.<br /><br />Exploit the Gap: At 18th level, a bow nomad can exploit the natural weaknesses of her foes. When a bow nomad makes a full attack with her twin bows, each arrow that deals damage in that attack also reduces the target&rsquo;s natural armor bonus (if any) by 1 (to a minimum of 0) for 1 round.<br /><br />This ability replaces favored terrain.<br /><br />Focused Fire (Ex): At 6th level, the bow nomad must select the Manyshot feat as her 6th-level combat style feat. In addition to the normal benefit of Manyshot, the bow nomad can specify the bow in her off hands as the source of the second arrow (precision damage and critical damage are still only added once). The bow nomad takes no two-weapon penalties when using this ability, but she cannot use it and Two-Weapon Fighting in the same round. The nomad can still choose to use Manyshot in the normal manner.<br /><br />At 11th and 16th level, the bow nomad can apply this ability to each of her iterative attacks. This ability alters the 6th-level combat style feat and replaces camouflage and hide in plain sight.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"2P5O4HjGEpzAN1DU"}

The most skilled of these thrillseekers are called ba-sadhaks, or fortune-finders. So successful have these canny explorers been at exploring Golarion at large that the secrets of their success are closely guarded, resulting in only extremely rare nonvanaran fortune-finders.<br /><br />Hinterlander (Ex): A fortune-finder adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) on all Climb and Swim checks.<br /><br />This replaces track.<br /><br />Adaptable Study (Ex): At 4th level, a fortune-finder can adapt and orient himself to new environments and new enemies. He gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks whenever he is in a terrain he hasn&rsquo;t selected as one of his favored terrains. He leaves no trail and can&rsquo;t be tracked in any such terrain (though he can leave a trail if he so chooses).<br /><br />In addition to this, the fortune-finder can study an opponent he can see as a move action. He then gains a bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, as well as on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The bonus is equal to half the fortune-finder&rsquo;s highest favored enemy bonus. A fortune-finder can&rsquo;t attempt Knowledge checks untrained to identify an opponent he has studied with adaptable study. Bonuses from adaptable study don&rsquo;t stack with those from the favored enemy ability. The ranger can study only a single target at a time.<br /><br />This ability replaces hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Trailblazer (Ex): Starting at 7th level, a fortune-finder can move through any sort of difficult terrain at his normal speed. Terrain that is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede movement, however, still affects the fortune-finder.<br /><br />This ability replaces woodland stride.<br /><br />Fast Study (Ex): Beginning at 11th level, a fortune-finder can study an opponent using adaptable study as a swift or move action. In addition to this, he can maintain bonuses from adaptable study against one additional opponent. At 19th level, he can study an opponent using adaptable study as an immediate, swift, or move action and can maintain the bonuses from adaptable study against a total of three opponents.<br /><br />This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.<br /><br />Master Explorer (Ex): A fortune-finder of 20th level becomes a master explorer. He can move through any sort of terrain that impedes movement at his full speed, even if it is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion. As a full-round action, he can study one opponent he can see and has already studied with adaptable study, increasing the benefits he gains from that ability to equal his full favored enemy bonus.<br /><br />This ability replaces master hunter.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"3333cJpNL5Z0xBar"}
{"name":"Ranger(Dandy)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Intrigue pg. 41</a><br />The antithesis of the gruff and wild woodsmen, a dandy takes effort to master the subtle etiquette of noble courts, the whispers of dark rumors, and the customs of the cultured world. Nonetheless, he is still a ranger at heart, and he hunts for rumors and gossip throughout the grand ballrooms of the wealthy and powerful just as most rangers hunt for enemies in the wilderness.<br /><br />Class Skills: A dandy adds Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), and Sense Motive to his list of class skills, instead of Handle Animal, Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), and Survival.<br /><br />This alters the ranger&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Favored Nation (Ex): Each time he would select a favored enemy, a dandy instead selects a country with whose courtly graces he is wholly versed and studied. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against courtiers, officials, nobles, and gentry from that nation. Likewise, he gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them.<br /><br />A dandy can attempt the appropriate Knowledge checks untrained to identify such people from the selected country. A dandy gains additional favored nations, and can increase the bonuses of one of his current favored nations, in the same way he would with a normal ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy.<br /><br />This ability replaces favored enemy.<br /><br />Rumor Empathy (Ex): A dandy can alter the flow and spread of rumors in his favor. This functions similarly to wild empathy, except that it takes 1 day (8 hours of work), instead of 1 minute, and it affects the general tenor of a rumor instead of a wild animal.<br /><br />A successful rumor empathy check allows the dandy to increase or decrease the rumor&rsquo;s tone by one step. For example, he could make an indifferent rumor friendly and thus positive toward its target, or an unfriendly rumor hostile and thus even more negative toward its target than it was originally.<br /><br />The difficulty of influencing a rumor depends on the size of the community in which it is spreading. The DC of the check is 15 in a village or smaller settlement. This DC increases by 5 and the number of days required to attempt the check increases by 2 for every settlement size category larger than a village&mdash;to a maximum of DC 40 and 11 days to affect a rumor spreading through an entire metropolis.<br /><br />If the rumor is only spreading through a smaller segment of the population, such as the elven district in a larger metropolis, use the population of that smaller segment to determine the DC and number of days of work required to use rumor empathy. The DC also increases by 10 if the rumor is about the dandy himself, since the dandy is obviously a biased source with respects to rumors about his own person.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Favored Terrain (Ex): At 3rd level, a dandy gains favored terrain (urban), and though the ability continues to increase at the same levels, he doesn&rsquo;t add additional terrains. However, at 8th level, whenever he is at a courtly function or party, his favored terrain bonuses increase by an additional 2.<br /><br />This ability alters favored terrain.<br /><br />Hobnob (Ex): At 4th level, a dandy must choose his allies as his hunter&rsquo;s bond, not an animal companion. In addition to the usual hunter&rsquo;s bond ability, the dandy can spend 10 minutes at a particular event or party hobnobbing and introducing his allies to the right people in order to provide them with half the skill bonuses of his favored nation (though not the bonuses on attack and damage rolls) for the duration of the event.<br /><br />This ability alters hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Dandy Spells (Su): At 4th level, the dandy gains a different sort of spellcasting than most rangers. A dandy uses his Charisma instead of his Wisdom to determine spells per day, DCs, and other factors related to spellcasting. He casts spells spontaneously from the bard spell list (rather than the ranger spell list) with the same number of spells known and spells per day as a medium (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 30) of his ranger level.<br /><br />This ability alters the ranger&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Party Crasher (Ex): At 7th level, the dandy is able to finagle his way into fancy parties, kings&rsquo; balls, and other social events meant for the cream of society. To do so, he must attempt a DC 25 Diplomacy check, which takes 1d4 hours. If he succeeds, he finds himself an invitation, an invitee looking for a date, a staff member willing to look the other way, or some other way to enter the party. This does not allow him to break into restricted areas or to infiltrate strictly closed gatherings, such as secret meetings; it only allows him access to social events.<br /><br />This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"4DRQUufeEHsIQEin"}

Only basic concepts can be conveyed or understood, such as &ldquo;I need help,&rdquo; &ldquo;I come in peace,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come over here,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go over there,&rdquo; and the like. This allows the wilderness explorer to ignore the common language requirement of social interaction and language-dependent spells and effects, but he can do so only when the information being shared is relatively simple. The creature with which the wilderness explorer communicates must understand at least one language for this ability to function.<br /><br />Additionally, a wilderness explorer can peacefully influence the initial attitude of humanoids that have Intelligence scores of 2 or lower. This ability functions just like wild empathy, but it works on humanoids instead of on animals. The wilderness explorer can also use this ability to influence a monstrous humanoid with 2 or lower Intelligence, but the wilderness explorer takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the check.<br /><br />This replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Hazard Sense (Ex): At 4th level, a wilderness explorer gains an intuitive understanding of natural hazards and traps fashioned from a natural environment.

This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.<br /><br />This replaces hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Indigenous Spirit (Su): At 8th level, a wilderness explorer attracts the aid of native spirits, which reward his appreciation of their home with whispered warnings.

Although the White Witches are spellcasters of immense power, even they cannot defend themselves against every attack. Witchguards dedicate their lives to protecting their charges, and they gain some arcane knowledge in return. They are trained to work closely with witches and defend their charges from harm. Witchguards learn magical abilities from the same patrons that grant witches their powers, though they can use their abilities to protect any kind of spellcaster, not just a witch. A witchguard is ready to face any foe that might threaten his charge, and he is ever prepared to lay down his life to protect the life of the person he is sworn to defend.<br /><br />Class Skills: A witchguard adds Knowledge (nobility) and Sense Motive to his list of class skills, and removes Handle Animal and Knowledge (dungeoneering) from his list of class skills.<br /><br />Defend Charge (Ex): At 4th level, a witchguard forms a bond with a spellcaster he has sworn to defend. Once per day, this bond allows the witchguard to spend a move action to grant an adjacent spellcaster a +2 dodge bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 2.

This patron is usually the same as the patron of the witch he is sworn to protect, but the witchguard may choose any patron. The witchguard adds the first four spells from his patron&rsquo;s spell list to his ranger spell list. The witchguard cannot cast patron spells of a level he is unable to cast.<br /><br />Sworn Defender (Ex): At 7th level, a witchguard gains In Harm&rsquo;s WayAPG&nbsp;as a bonus feat.

His bonuses from his first favored enemy apply to creatures with one or more of the following templates: blighted fey, fungal creature, fungoid, Mana Wastes mutant, mutant, mutant goblin, and plagued beast. Additionally, the bonuses apply against creatures with the blight subtype.<br /><br />Each time the blightwarden gains a new favored enemy, his additional +2 bonus always applies to this first favored enemy.<br /><br />This alters favored enemy.<br /><br />Emulate Taint (Ex, Su, or Sp): Once per day as a standard action, a blightwarden can examine visible evidence of a creature that has been affected by a natural or supernatural blight. This might include visible tracks left by a creature with the fungal creature template, or a dead creature with the blighted fey template, or any similar evidence left by any creature as described in the hunt the blighted fey ability.<br /><br />When the blightwarden does this, for the next 24 hours, he can use any one extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability granted by the template (or the blight subtype) for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level. This duration need not be used all at once, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. Saving throw DCs for this ability are calculated as if the blightwarden had the relevant template (for example, the DC of an ability from the blighted fey template would be equal to 10 + half the blightwarden&rsquo;s Hit Dice + his Constitution modifier). He cannot use abilities that would create a permanent effect beyond this ability&rsquo;s duration, and can never use more than one ability from a template or subtype in this way during a single 24-hour period.<br /><br />For example, the blightwarden cannot use a blighted ooze&rsquo;s cursed domain ability to create a domain of evil. However, the blightwarden could gain a blighted fey&rsquo;s thorn throw ability for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level (in this case, the blightwarden would gain a thorn attack for that duration).<br /><br />This replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Blightwalker (Ex): At 3rd level, a blightwarden gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when in areas afflicted by a natural or supernatural blight. Blighted areas include cursed lands (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures&nbsp;143), domains of evil (Horror Adventures&nbsp;159), regions negatively affected by a spell or ability that affects at least a 300-square-foot area, or regions where a specific affliction is prevalent. In addition, the blightwarden adds this bonus to ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks to avoid natural and supernatural hazards in blighted areas. He can choose to improve this bonus in place of improving a favored terrain bonus. A blightwarden traveling through blighted areas leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he can leave a trail if he chooses).<br /><br />This alters favored terrain and replaces the blightwarden&rsquo;s first favored terrain.<br /><br />Resist Corruption (Ex): At 3rd level, a blightwarden gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against curses, diseases, mind-affecting effects, poisons, and transmutation effects.<br /><br />This replaces endurance.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"7ZNtkwosLixmzRI3"}

On a success, the dragon hunter is able to deduce the species, age category, size, and color of the dragon. If the trail is less than 48 hours old, the dragon hunter gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the Knowledge check. This ability replaces Track.<br /><br />Wyrm Hatred (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, a dragon hunter must select dragons as his favored enemy, granting him a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of the dragon type. He also gains +2 bonuses on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. These bonuses increase by +2 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level).<br /><br />Dragoncrafting (Ex): Dragon hunters are experts not only at tracking and killing dragons, but also at using dragon bodies to craft unique equipment. A dragon hunter gains Dragoncrafting as a bonus feat at 5th level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. See page 18 of this book for more information.

He regains panache through critical hits and killing blows when using a bow of any kind, rather than when using a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. If the hooded champion has this ability and the panache ability from another class or archetype, the panache points from the two sources do not stack, but the hooded champion regains panache in any way either class feature allows him to.

Eventually, the demon&rsquo;s presence in the forest drew the elves back to Golarion, who sought to purge the fiendish blight from this once-sacred land. They defeated Treerazer but could not destroy him, forcing him instead into the southern reaches of the Fierani, a corrupted region of twisted plants and fiendish denizens called Tanglebriar. Even today, the elves constantly battle to keep the corruption in the Tanglebriar from spreading to the rest of the Fierani Forest and beyond.

Nirmathas has no formal military, for her people love their freedom and are reluctant to take orders from anyone, so her defense falls to individual scouts and small groups of allied commandos. Many of Nirmathas&rsquo;s rangers take the guide or skirmisher archetypes (see the&nbsp;Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide), but some focus on the magic of stealth. These irregular troops fight against the frequent invasions by Molthuni soldiers, striking quickly and melting into the green shadows as soon as their opponents rally themselves for a counterattack. A Nirmathi irregular has the following class features.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A Nirmathi irregular is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor. This replaces the normal ranger armor and weapon proficiency.<br /><br />Focused Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, a Nirmathi irregular selects one favored enemy (usually &ldquo;humanoid [human]&rdquo;). He does not gain additional favored enemies at higher levels. He does get to increase his favored enemy bonus by +2 at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level. This otherwise acts as and replaces the standard favored enemy ability.<br /><br />Forest Ghost (Ex): At 1st level, a Nirmathi irregular adds a bonus equal to 1/2 his level on all Perception and Survival skill checks he makes while located in forest terrain. This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Focused Terrain: At 3rd level, a Nirmathi irregular selects one favored terrain (usually &ldquo;forest&rdquo;). He does not gain additional favored terrains at higher levels. He does get to increase his favored terrain bonus by +2 at 8th, 13th, and 18th level. This otherwise acts as and replaces the standard favored enemy ability.<br /><br />Spells: At 4th level, a Nirmathi irregular increases his number of spells per day by +1 for every spell level. This means the irregular gets at least 1 spell per day as soon as he gains access to a level of spells, even if Table 3&ndash;12: Ranger in the&nbsp;Core Rulebook&nbsp;lists 0 for spells per day.<br /><br />A Nirmathi irregular also learns to draw upon druidic magic, perhaps from association with the druids of Crystalhurst or a natural connection to the magic of the Fangwood. Each day when the ranger prepares spells, he may choose one druid spell and prepare it as if it were on the ranger spell list as a ranger spell of its druid spell level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"C0YZ8lLzHj0CO8TB"}

Skirmishers rely on their wits, their wisdom, and sometimes even instinct to aid in their quests. A skirmisher has the following class features.<br /><br />Hunter&rsquo;s Tricks: At 5th level, a skirmisher ranger learns the use of hunter&rsquo;s tricks, which typically grant a boon or bonus to the ranger or a nearby ally. At 5th level, the ranger learns one trick, selected from the list below. At 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, he learns another trick. A ranger can use these tricks a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. Tricks are usually swift actions, but sometimes move or free actions that modify a standard action, usually an attack action. Once a trick is chosen, it can&rsquo;t be retrained. A ranger cannot select an individual trick more than once. This ability replaces the ranger&rsquo;s spells class feature. Skirmishers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items.<br /><br />The following is a list of hunter tricks and their effects.<br /><br />Aiding Attack (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as a free action when he hits a creature with an attack. The next ally who makes an attack against the target creature before the start of the ranger&rsquo;s next turn gains a +2 circumstance bonus on that attack roll.<br />Bolster Companion (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when his animal companion is hit with an attack or a combat maneuver. The companion&rsquo;s AC and combat maneuver defense increase by +4 for the purposes of that attack. If the attack still hits, the animal companion only takes half damage (if any). The animal companion must be able to see and hear the ranger to benefit from this trick.<br />Catfall (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when he falls 20 or more feet, ignoring the first 20 feet of the fall when calculating the falling damage. If the ranger takes no damage from the fall, he does not fall prone.<br />Chameleon Step (Ex): The ranger can move up to twice his speed as a move action. The ranger does not take any penalty on Stealth checks for movement during this move. This move provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.<br />Cunning Pantomime (Ex): As a standard action, the ranger can communicate with a single creature as if using the&nbsp;tongues&nbsp;spell for 10 minutes. Because the communication is slow and lacks subtlety, the ranger suffers a &ndash;4 penalty on all Bluff and Diplomacy checks relating to the creature he is communicating with when using this trick.<br />Defensive Bow Stance (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as a swift action. Until the start of his next turn, his ranged attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br />Deft Stand (Ex): The ranger can spend a move action to stand up without provoking attacks of opportunity.<br />Distracting Attack (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as a free action before he makes an attack. If the attack hits, the target takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls for 1 round.<br />Hateful Attack (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as a free action when he makes an attack against one of his favored enemies. The ranger doubles the threat range of his weapon for this attack. This does not stack with other abilities that increase a weapon&rsquo;s threat range.<br />Heel (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when his animal companion moves. When the companion moves, the square it starts out in is not considered threatened by any opponent it can see, and therefore visible enemies do not get attacks of opportunity against it when it moves from that square. The companion must end this movement in a square adjacent to the ranger. The animal companion must be able to see and hear the ranger to take this movement.<br />Hobbling Attack (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as a free action when he hits with an attack. The target of the attack&rsquo;s land speed is reduced by 1/2 for 1d4 rounds.<br />Quick Climb (Ex): The ranger can climb at his full speed as a move action without penalty.<br />Quick Healing (Ex): As a swift action, the ranger can make a Heal check to administer first aid on an adjacent dying character. Alternatively, the ranger can administer a potion to an unconscious character as a move action.<br />Quick Swim (Ex): The ranger can swim at his full speed as a move action without penalty.<br />Ranger&rsquo;s Counsel (Ex): As a swift action, the ranger can grant all allies within 30 feet that are within line of sight and can hear him a +2 bonus on skill checks with a single skill of his choice. The ranger must have at least one rank in the chosen skill. This bonus lasts for 1 round.<br />Rattling Strike (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as a free action before he makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, the target is shaken for 1d4 rounds.<br />Second Chance Strike (Ex): When he misses with a melee attack, the ranger may reroll his attack at a &ndash;5 penalty. Using this ability is an immediate action.<br />Sic &rsquo;Em (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as a swift action. His animal companion makes one melee attack against an adjacent creature. The animal companion must be able to see and hear the ranger to make this attack.<br />Skill Sage (Ex): As a free action, the ranger can roll twice on any one skill check and take the better result. He must have at least 1 rank in that skill to use this ability.<br />Stag&rsquo;s Leap (Ex): As a free action, the ranger can attempt a running jump without moving 10 feet before the jump.<br />Surprise Shift (Ex): The ranger can move 5 feet as a swift action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step.<br />Tangling Attack (Ex): The ranger can use this attack as a free action when he makes an attack. If the attack hits, the target is entangled for 1 round.<br />Trick Shot (Ex): As a standard action, the ranger can make a ranged attack that ignores concealment (but not total concealment), soft cover, and partial cover.<br />Uncanny Senses (Ex): As an immediate action, the ranger gains a +10 insight bonus on Perception checks for 1 round.<br />Upending Strike (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as a free action just before he makes a melee attack. If the attack hits, he may make a free trip combat maneuver against the target.<br />Vengeance Strike (Ex): The ranger can use this trick as an immediate action when an enemy adjacent to him hits an ally with a melee or ranged attack. The ranger can make a single melee attack at his highest base attack bonus against the creature who attacked his ally.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"CN3ZrOSkzl9OMWOF"}

Whether by curse, disease, ancient rite, a slight lycanthropic influence in the blood, or the corrupting influence of chaos, these rangers embrace the wild to transform themselves into something untamed and feral. Shapeshifters are often held in awe, but are even more often feared. A shapeshifter has the following class features.<br /><br />Combat Style Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, a shapeshifter ranger must choose the natural weapon combat style.<br /><br />Shifter&rsquo;s Blessing (Su): At 3rd level, the shapeshifter can take on the aspects of a wild creature once per day as a swift action. He can remain in this form for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level + his Wisdom modifier. While in one of his shifter&rsquo;s blessing forms, the ranger gains the shapeshifter subtype.<br /><br />The shapeshifter must choose one of the following forms. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.<br /><br />Form of the Bear: The ranger&rsquo;s muscles enlarge and tighten, and his facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but his base speed becomes 20 feet.<br />Form of the Cat: The ranger&rsquo;s muscles become lean and defined, and his gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger increases his base speed by 10 feet, and he gains a +4 bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks.<br />Form of the Dragon: The ranger&rsquo;s skin becomes rough and scaly. While in this form, the ranger gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.<br />Form of the Eagle: The ranger&rsquo;s skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10 bonus on Perception checks.<br />Form of the Jackal: The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger can spend a move action to move up to 1/2 his speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.<br />Form of the Otter: The ranger&rsquo;s hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 30 feet and a +8 bonus on Swim checks.<br /><br />At 8th level and again every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional form for his shifter&rsquo;s blessing and may use this ability one additional time per day. This is not a polymorph ability; a ranger with shifter&rsquo;s blessing in one of his shifted forms can be affected by a polymorph ability and retain his bonus and traits gained by the class feature. This ability replaces favored terrain.<br /><br />Dual Form Shifter (Ex): At 12th level, when the shapeshifter takes on a shifter&rsquo;s blessing form, he can take on a hybrid of two of his forms. He gains the bonuses for both forms. This ability replaces camouflage.<br /><br />Master Shifter (Su): At 20th level, the ranger&rsquo;s shifter&rsquo;s blessing forms improve, and he can take on true forms of beasts. The ranger can use dual form shifter with this ability, although he cannot use more than one polymorph effect at any one time. This ability replaces master hunter. The ranger&rsquo;s forms from shifter&rsquo;s blessing improve to the following:<br /><br />Form of the Bear: The ranger&rsquo;s muscles enlarge and tighten, and his facial features become more ursine. While in this form, the ranger gains a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength and he does not suffer any reduction of speed. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a bear as if the caster of&nbsp;beast shape IV.<br />Form of the Cat: The ranger&rsquo;s muscles become lean and defined, and his gait more deliberate and graceful. While in this form, the ranger increases his base speed by 20 feet and he gains a +10 bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a cat of any size as if the caster of&nbsp;beast shape IV.<br />Form of the Dragon: The ranger&rsquo;s skin becomes rough and scaly. While in this form, the ranger gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC and a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Alternately, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a dragon as if the caster of&nbsp;form of the dragon I.<br />Form of the Eagle: The ranger&rsquo;s skin stretches, his nose becomes hooked, and his eyes enlarge. While in this form, the ranger gains a +10 bonus on Perception checks and a fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of an eagle or similar raptor as if the caster of&nbsp;beast shape IV.<br />Form of the Jackal: The ranger becomes thin and hyperactive, his movements taking on a nervous spryness. While in this form, the ranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity due to movement. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of a jackal or other canine creature as if the caster of&nbsp;beast shape IV.<br />Form of the Otter: The ranger&rsquo;s hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 60 feet and a +5 bonus on Swim checks. Alternatively, the ranger can polymorph into the form of an otter or similar river mammal as if the caster of&nbsp;beast shape IV.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"DDxMHbcJOUpkgmYL"}

The DC of this save is equal to 10 + half the ranger&rsquo;s level + the ranger&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier. An Abendego diver can instead deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature&rsquo;s current hit points. A successful save negates this damage.

Many Kellid locals blame Kevoth-Kul&rsquo;s change on the influence of the Technic League and view both the League and their mechanical minions with a mix of fear and distrust. Some Kellid rangers have since developed skills to defeat the League&rsquo;s robotic enforcers and devious arcanists.<br /><br />Class Skills: A galvanic saboteur adds Disable Device and Knowledge (arcana) to his list of class skills and removes Handle Animal and Knowledge (dungeoneering) from his list of class skills.<br /><br />Favored Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, a galvanic saboteur must select construct creatures as his first favored enemy. This ability alters favored enemy.<br /><br />Reprogram (Ex): At 1st level, a galvanic saboteur can improve the initial attitude of a mindless construct. This ability functions as wild empathy, except only against mindless constructs. The ranger can use this ability against constructs with an Intelligence score, but he takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the check. This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Lucky Dodge (Ex): At 3rd level, a galvanic saboteur can dodge the precise attacks of even the most technologically advanced foes. The ranger gains a luck bonus to AC against attacks that target his touch AC as long as his opponent&rsquo;s type matches that of his first favored enemy. This luck bonus is equal to 1/2 the ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy bonus against that creature type. At 8th, 13th, and 18th levels, the ranger gains this luck bonus to AC against attacks that target touch his AC as long as his opponent&rsquo;s type matches his second, third, and fourth favored enemy, respectively. A galvanic saboteur&rsquo;s animal companion (if he chose one for his hunter&rsquo;s bond) also gains this luck bonus. This ability replaces favored terrain.<br /><br />Technological Trapsmith (Ex): At 7th level, a galvanic saboteur can rig technological traps using the remains of destroyed constructs with the clockwork or robot subtype. To successfully rig such a trap, the ranger must spend 1 minute working on the destroyed construct and succeed at a Disable Device check (DC = 10 + the construct&rsquo;s HD). On a failure, the trap doesn&rsquo;t function and the construct&rsquo;s remains are ruined. On a success, the ranger creates a mechanical trap with the following statistics.</p>\n<h2>Rigged Construct Trap</h2>\n<p>Type&nbsp;mechanical;&nbsp;Perception&nbsp;DC 20;&nbsp;Disable Device&nbsp;DC 20</p>\n<h3>Effects</h3>\n<p>Trigger&nbsp;location (all spaces occupied by the construct&rsquo;s remains);&nbsp;Reset&nbsp;none<br />Effect&nbsp;blast of electricity (1d6 electricity damage/2 HD of construct); Reflex negates (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ranger&rsquo;s level + his Intelligence modifier); multiple targets (all targets within 5 ft. of construct&rsquo;s remains)<br /><br />Other types of destroyed constructs can serve as suitable materials for a rigged construct trap (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion). Constructs destroyed by&nbsp;disintegrate&nbsp;or similar effects that leave no intact remains cannot be used to create a rigged construct trap. This ability replaces woodland stride.<br /><br />Static Strike (Ex): At 8th level, the galvanic saboteur has gathered enough parts and scrap from his constructed enemies that he can infuse some of his attacks with a bit of their alien energy. Once per day as a standard action, the ranger can make a static strike as a melee attack at his full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage and the ranger can make an additional attack at his full base attack bonus against a foe that is adjacent to the previous foe and still within his reach, as if he had Cleave, except he doesn&rsquo;t take a &ndash;2 penalty to his AC and the second attack deals an additional 2d6 points of electricity damage. At 12th level, the ranger can continue to make attacks against adjacent creatures, as if he had Greater Cleave, with each hit increasing the amount of electricity damage dealt to the next foe in line. The ranger can use this ability twice per day at 14th level and three times per day at 20th level. This ability replaces swift tracker and camouflage.<br /><br />Sensor Evasion (Su): At 17th level, a galvanic saboteur has mastered the art of evading technological and magical observation. He can use the Stealth skill against constructs and magical sensors (such as those created by&nbsp;arcane eye&nbsp;or&nbsp;clairaudience/clairvoyance) even while being observed. This ability replaces hide in plain sight.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"EzbUZfMj3TcWDwKI"}

Instead, these shrewd warriors alter their focus and dedicate their efforts to dismantling enemy organizations. Guildbreakers stoke their enmity for their foes, and they train to track the movements of rival organizations, and even to infiltrate these groups to gather secret intelligence.<br /><br />Class Skills: A guildbreaker adds Bluff, Disguise, and Knowledge (local) to his list of class skills, instead of Handle Animal, Heal, and Knowledge (geography).<br /><br />This alters the ranger&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Favored Organization (Ex): When a guildbreaker selects a favored enemy, he can opt to select a specific organization, such as a particular thieves&rsquo; guild, in lieu of a specific creature type. The guildbreaker must select this option for his first favored enemy, but he can choose either option for his later favored enemies. The guildbreaker&rsquo;s bonuses from favored enemy apply against official members of this organization regardless of their creature type, but not against the organization&rsquo;s allies, paid mercenaries, or forced labor. This ability only applies if the guildbreaker knows that the target is a member of the organization.<br /><br />This ability alters favored enemy.<br /><br />Read the City (Ex): A guildbreaker spends most of his time in cities and large population centers. As a result, he gains an innate sense of comings and goings in the hustle around him. When in an urban environment, a guildbreaker can use the Survival skill to gather information, but only about the movements of creatures and what sort of people (races, social classes, predominant professions, and the like) occupy the community. Unlike with the normal way to gather information, the guildbreaker studies the signs of the city instead of asking around, so it doesn&rsquo;t spread word about the nature of his questions to others.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Deep Cover (Ex, Su): Guildbreakers may work to dismantle their enemies&rsquo; power structures from within, and they know how to gather resources and the necessary trappings in order to masquerade as a member of those organizations. At 4th level, a guildbreaker adds a circumstance bonus equal to twice his favored organization bonus to all Bluff and Disguise checks to appear to be a member of the organization (this does not apply on Disguise checks to change his appearance and replace a specific member, but rather to checks related to appear to be a general member of the organization).<br /><br />The bonus on Bluff checks from deep cover stacks with the guildbreaker&rsquo;s overall bonus from favored organization if the person he is attempting to deceive is also a member of that organization.<br /><br />A guildbreaker posing as a member of one of his favored enemy organizations automatically defeats truth-telling magic (as if under the effects of&nbsp;glibness), but only for the purpose of claiming to be a member of the organization. Truth-telling magic can still expose him with a more indirect question, such as a member of a non-religious evil organization asking the guildbreaker for the identity of his patron deity.<br /><br />This ability replaces hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Crowd Stride (Ex): At 7th level, a guildbreaker can slip through crowded streets with ease. His movement speed is not reduced when moving through a crowd.<br /><br />This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"F0dIQyTgD7sCfqY0"}

An urban ranger has the following class features.<br /><br />Urban Ranger: At 1st level, an urban ranger adds Disable Device and Knowledge (local) to his list of class skills and removes Handle Animal and Knowledge (nature) from his list of class skills.<br /><br />Favored Community (Ex): At 3rd level, the urban ranger forms a bond with a community. While inside the limits of this community, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. An urban ranger traveling through his favored community leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although he may leave a trail if he so desires).<br /><br />At 8th level, and every five levels thereafter, an urban ranger may select an additional favored community. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored community (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.<br /><br />For the purposes of this ability, a community is any settlement consisting of 100 or more individuals. The community may be larger than this minimum. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are not considered part of a community. This ability replaces favored terrain.<br /><br />Trapfinding (Ex): At 3rd level, an urban ranger can find and disable traps, as the rogue class feature of the same name. This ability replaces endurance.<br /><br />Push Through (Ex): At 7th level, an urban ranger is never slowed by difficult terrain in his favored communities. In addition, he can move through the space occupied by local citizens as if they were allies. This does not apply to creatures intent on harming the ranger. Areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him. This replaces woodland stride.<br /><br />Blend In (Ex): An urban ranger of 12th level or higher can use his Stealth bonus in place of a Disguise skill check in any of his favored communities. This disguise does not take an action to don. He must make a check whenever someone attempts to pick him out from the local citizens. If his check is successful, he blends into the crowd. While not invisible, enemies do not notice his presence and take no actions against him unless they are taking actions against the local citizens in general. This replaces camouflage.<br /><br />Invisibility Trick (Sp): At 17th level, the urban ranger can cast&nbsp;greater invisibility&nbsp;on himself as a wizard of his ranger level as a swift action. He can use this spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).

Her uncanny skills are in ready demand by city guards, business owners, and even criminal organizations that desire to keep the authorities out of their disreputable affairs.<br /><br />Mugshot (Sp): A sentinel can spend 1 minute studying the appearance of a target or a likeness of the target in the form of a picture, carving, or visual illusion and memorize it with perfect recall. From that point on, the sentinel gains a +4 bonus on Perception checks to notice the target in disguise or pick him out of a crowd. The sentinel is automatically allowed a Perception check against the target&rsquo;s Disguise check whenever she sees the target, even if the individual isn&rsquo;t doing anything to draw attention to himself. A sentinel can memorize the appearance of a number of targets equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) at any given time. Once a sentinel has reached her maximum number of memorized appearances, she must forget one of the memorized faces before gaining a new one.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Uncanny Alertness (Ex): At 4th level, a sentinel is always ready to defend against incoming attacks. A sentinel is never flat-footed before acting in combat, even if she is surprised (she can still become flat-footed by any other effect or situation that would render her flat-footed).<br /><br />At 7th level, the sentinel also always acts on the surprise round. If she would have acted on the surprise round anyway, or if there is no surprise round, she gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to half her ranger level.<br /><br />This ability replaces a ranger&rsquo;s hunter&rsquo;s bond and woodland stride.<br /><br />Sense Intruder (Su): At 6th level, a sentinel gains the ability to establish an incredibly effective watch by standing still and focusing on all of her senses as once. At any time, she can spend 1 minute setting up this ability. Once she has done so, she must stand still, taking no other actions except to keep track of her surroundings; she can&rsquo;t even take free actions like talking. Her heightened senses grant her a supernatural awareness of her surroundings within 20 feet. If any Tiny or larger creature enters the area over which her awareness extends, she automatically knows that it did so (this part of the ability is a divination effect and can&rsquo;t be deceived by spells that block sensory input, only by extreme effects like&nbsp;mind blank). Furthermore, unless that creature is simultaneously negating its visual, auditory, and scent stimuli (such as by being under&nbsp;invisibility, silence, and&nbsp;negate aromaAPG&nbsp;all at once), the sentinel can attempt a Perception check as an immediate action to pinpoint the intruder&rsquo;s location, ignoring any Stealth bonuses the intruder might gain from effects that obscure only one of those senses, such as invisibility, camouflage, or other spells or abilities.<br /><br />This sort of heightened analysis of sensory stimuli is taxing, as much so as hustling overland for an equivalent period of time, despite not moving from a single spot. The sentinel can use this ability for 1 hour without penalty. Using sense intruder for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage to the sentinel, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour. A sentinel who takes any nonlethal damage from using this ability becomes fatigued. Each hour the sentinel uses sense intruder also counts as 1 hour of hustling overland for the purpose of determining how much nonlethal damage the sentinel takes in a single day.<br /><br />Starting at 10th level, whenever the sentinel gains a combat style feat, she can choose to trade it for a 10-foot increase in the radius of this ability.<br /><br />This ability replaces the combat style feat gained at 6th level and alters combat style feats.<br /><br />Mugshot Quarry (Ex): At 11th level, the sentinel can activate her quarry ability (and her improved quarry ability at 19th level) against any of the targets she has memorized with the mugshot ability, even if the creature in question is not within her line of sight.<br /><br />This ability alters quarry and improved quarry.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"HFZ3OuYOYXwlUZUe"}

He selects two warpriest domains from among the domains granted by his deity, and gains the minor blessings of those domains. A divine tracker can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain. If a divine tracker isn&rsquo;t devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval. The restriction on alignment domains still applies. A divine tracker uses his ranger level as his warpriest level to determine the effect of the blessing.

Unique among rangers, they can bond with multiple animals of any kind, creating a menagerie of wild yet loyal creatures, like a strange family. A beast master has the following class features.<br /><br />Class Skills: A beast master&rsquo;s class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Wis). These replace the standard ranger class skills.<br /><br />Animal Companion (Ex): A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger&rsquo;s effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &ndash; 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master&rsquo;s choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choices&mdash;he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can.<br /><br />The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master&rsquo;s effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger&rsquo;s service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Improved Empathic Link (Su): The beast master gains an empathic link with all of his animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the ranger can also see through a companion&rsquo;s eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as he likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection. This replaces the 6th-level combat style feat.<br /><br />Strong Bond (Ex): At 12th level, the ranger strengthens his bond with his animal companions. The ranger&rsquo;s effective druid level for his animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he may immediately allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees fit.

Once a trap is learned, it can&rsquo;t be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The trapper cannot select an individual trap more than once. This ability replaces the ranger&rsquo;s spells class feature. Trappers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items.<br /><br />Launch Trap: At 10th level, a trapper can affix a magical ranger trap to an arrow, crossbow bolt, or thrown weapon, allowing her to set the trap remotely or use it as a direct attack. Attaching the trap to the projectile is part of the full-round action of creating a new trap. The trapped projectile is fired or thrown in the normal manner. If fired at a square, the trap is treated as if the ranger had set the trap in that square, except the DC is 5 lower than normal. If fired at a creature, the target takes damage from the ranged weapon and is treated as if it had triggered the trap (saving throw applies, if any). The attack has a maximum range of 60 feet, and range increments apply to the attack roll. The duration of the trapped projectile starts from when it is created, not from when it is used.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"KnRcEbpc5JS3o6VP"}

Adept at hunting in dusk, darkness, and twilight, these rangers excel at manipulating shadows.<br /><br />Class Skills: The dusk stalker adds Knowledge (planes) to his list of class skills and removes Knowledge (nature) from his list of class skills.<br /><br />Shadow Guide: When a dusk stalker gains the favored terrain ability, that ability is modified in the following ways. At 3rd level, a dusk stalker picks his primary terrain normally, but only gains a +1 bonus on those checks while on a plane other than the Shadow Plane, and gains a +3 bonus on those checks while on the Shadow Plane.

Furthermore, a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, the dusk stalker can manipulate shadows in a 5-foot square within 30 feet. That square must be in an area of dim light or darkness (magical or otherwise). Enemies with an Intelligence score within or adjacent to that 5-foot square take a &ndash;2 penalty to AC and on Reflex saving throws. The harassing shadows last for 1 round.

Favoring speed and evasive techniques over brute force, sword-devils choose precision over power and acrobatics over armor. Charismatic and carefree, a sword-devil makes fast friends and inspires her companions to greatness, even while vowing a swift death upon her enemies.<br /><br />Class Skills: The sword-devil gains Acrobatics as a class skill as a replacement for Spellcraft.<br /><br />Death Vow (Ex): At 1st level, a sword-devil may, as a swift action, focus all her fury and determination on a single foe she swears to slay. She may do this once per day, plus one additional time per day at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter (7th, 10th, etc). The sword-devil gains a bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against her sworn target equal to half her sword-devil level (minimum +1). The death vow effect remains until the target of the death vow is dead, or the next time the sword-devil rests and regains use of this ability.<br /><br />This ability replaces favored enemy.<br /><br />Slashing Fury (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, the sword-devil can use her Charisma score in place of her Intelligence score as a prerequisite for combat feats. Additionally, she selects one type of light or one- handed slashing melee weapon. When using this weapon, she may use her Dexterity modiﬁer instead of her Strength modiﬁer on melee attack rolls. At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter (13th and 18th). the sword-devil may select an additional type of light or one-handed slashing weapon she may use with this ability. This ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites.<br /><br />This ability replaces favored terrain.<br /><br />Inspiring Example (Ex): At 4th level, the sword-devil forms a bond with her companions, inspiring them to greater zeal in combat by the example of her weaponcraft. As a standard action, the sword-devil may grant half her death vow bonus against a single victim of her death vow to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the sword-devil's Charisma modiﬁer (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any death vow bonuses possessed by the sword-devil&lsquo;s allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.<br /><br />This ability replaces hunter's bond.<br /><br />Untouchable (Ex): At 4th level. the sword-devil's conﬁdence and personality distract her foes in combat, making her more difficult to hit. When unarmored and unencumbered. the sword-devil may add her Charisma bonus (ifany) to her AC and her CMD. In addition, the sword-devil gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC at 6th level, and every three sword-devil levels thereafter (9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th). She loses these bonuses when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carriers a medium or heavy load.<br /><br />This ability replaces spells.<br /><br />Second Combat Style (Ex): At 11th level, the sword-devil chooses a second ranger combat style. When she recieves a bonus combat feat, she may select any feat from either combat style's list.<br /><br />This ability replaces quarry.<br /><br />Seething Fury (Ex): At 19th level, the sword-devil's countless battles harden her soul and make her lose touch with her humanity. Her growing lack of control over her wrath fuels the potency of her death vow. She adds her Charisma bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against targets of her death vow, and automatically conﬁrms threatened critical hits against them.<br /><br />This ability replaces improved quarry.<br /><br />Avatar of Vengeance (Su): A sword-devil of 20th level becomes a living avatar of vengeance, infused with supernatural powers that push her beyond the mortal. Recognized for her battle prowess and unparalleled skill at killing by a potent otherworldly entity. The sword-devil becomes the living vessel of an immortal, intangible, and inscrutable being obsessed only with slaying her foes, meting out violent retribution to those who have wronged her, or simply dispatching her enemies in dazzling display of wanton destruction. As a standard action, the sword-devil allows herself to be infused with this killing spirit. She gains a fly speed of 60-feet (perfect), a +6 morale bonus to AC, and ﬁre resistance 30- This ability can be used for 10 minutes per day. but it must be used in 1-minute increments.<br /><br />This ability replaces master hunter.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"NhxqPgbIqEhTWuTZ"}

Though regular outdoorsmen might suffice in many cases, some large forces look to battle scouts to keep the body of their troops safe and prepared for the terrain and whatever dangers that terrain hides.<br /><br />Hunter&rsquo;s Bond (Ex): At 4th level, when a battle scout gains the hunter&rsquo;s bond ability, he must choose to bond with his companions. Battle scouts do not have animal companions.<br /><br />Advantageous Terrain (Ex): At 5th level, when a battle scout is within one of his favorite terrains, he can spend up to 3 consecutive rounds studying an area of terrain to gain the benefits below. Each round of studying terrain is a standard action. During the first round of studying terrain, the battle scout designates a 60-foot-radius-burst area from a single square within line of sight. Depending on how many rounds the battle scout spends studying the area, he or his allies gain the following benefits for 10 minutes per ranger level he possesses. (For example, if he spends 2 rounds, he or his allies gain the first two benefits.)<br /><br />1st Round: Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks while within the advantageous terrain area.<br /><br />2nd Round: Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while within the advantageous terrain area.<br /><br />3rd Round: The battle scout&rsquo;s movement is not hampered by difficult terrain while within the advantageous terrain area. Furthermore, the battle scout can take 10 on Climb and Swim checks and checks to jump while within the area, even when in immediate danger or distracted. This ability replaces the ranger&rsquo;s second favored enemy.<br /><br />Infiltration (Ex): At 10th level, once per day, a battle scout can choose a single terrain type that is not his favored terrain.

This ability replaces track.<br /><br />Aquatic Prowess Feat (Ex): At 2nd level and every four levels thereafter, a wave warden selects a bonus feat that improves his prowess in aquatic environments. He can choose these feats even if he does not meet the prerequisites. Initially, he may choose from the following feats: Dodge, Mobility, Net Adept, Net and Trident, Net Maneuvering, Precise Shot, Rapid Reload, Sea Hunter, and Two-Weapon Fighting.

Wild souls carry these more refined teachings back to the frontier lands of their birth, and they employ that knowledge in defense of their homes.<br /><br />Unfettered Soul: A wild soul swears to himself never to make use of advanced technology, alchemy, arcane magic, or firearms. He also must oppose their use on his person, refusing to be a willing target and attempting a saving throw if possible (even if the effect is harmless or beneficial). Violating this oath causes a wild soul to lose the abilities granted by this archetype until he atones.<br /><br />Nemesis (Ex): A wild soul gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Survival checks against creatures that wield advanced technology, alchemical weapons (including an alchemist&rsquo;s bombs), or firearms and against those that cast arcane spells (this does not apply to creatures that use spell-like abilities).

A target of this ability can negate this effect with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the ranger&rsquo;s level + his Wisdom modifier).

When he confirms a critical hit against a creature against whom his nemesis bonus applies, for 1 minute the target must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the wild soul&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier + twice the spell&rsquo;s level) to cast an arcane spell, create an extract, or use an alchemist&rsquo;s bomb, and the target can&rsquo;t spend or gain grit.<br /><br />This replaces improved quarry.<br /><br />Nemesis Slayer (Ex): At 20th level, a wild soul becomes death incarnate to his nemeses. As a standard action, he can make a single attack against a nemesis at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the wild soul&rsquo;s level + his Wisdom modifier) or die. The wild soul can instead deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature&rsquo;s current hit points, which the target can negate with a successful save at the same DC. The ranger can use this ability up to five times per day, but he cannot use it against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.<br /><br />This replaces master hunter.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"RvcLa5lD0fqzg4zA"}

Their ordeals and experiences combine the physical prowess gained as a result of life hunting dangerous beasts with the wisdom gained from surviving countless natural dangers to earn them the respect of the jungle&rsquo;s denizens, man and animal alike.<br /><br />Class Skills: The jungle lord gains Acrobatics and Linguistics as class skills instead of Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Spellcraft.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: A jungle lord is proﬁcient with the dagger, battleaxe, blowgun, bolas, club, greatclub, handaxe, kukri, lasso (Pathﬁnder RPG Ultimate Equipment 31), longbow, longspear, net, quarterstaff, shortbow, shortspear, sling, spear, and whip. Jungle Lords are not proﬁcient with armor and shields.<br /><br />This replaces the ranger&rsquo;s normal weapon and armor proﬁciencies.<br /><br />Bonus Language: A jungle lord's language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures.<br /><br />Animal Focus (Su): As a swift action, a jungle lord can take on the aspect of an animal, gaining a bonus or a special ability based on the type of animal emulated. This ability functions as the hunter&rsquo;s animal focus class feature (Pathﬁnder RPG Advanced Class Guide 27), though it applies only to the jungle lord and not an animal companion. The jungle lord can use this ability for 1 minute per day per ranger level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. He can emulate only one animal at a time.<br /><br />This ability replaces favored enemy.<br /><br />Favored Terrain (Ex): At 3rd level, a jungle lord must select jungle as his ﬁrst favored terrain.<br /><br />This alters favored terrain.<br /><br />Hunter&rsquo;s Bond (Ex): A jungle lord forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the jungle lord&rsquo;s effective druid level is equal to his ranger level -3. The jungle lord gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks regarding his animal companion. A jungle lord can choose his companion from the following list: ape, axe beakB3, baboonB2, bear, big cat (lion, tiger), bird, boar, crocodile (alligator), dinosaur (deinonychus, pteranodon&nbsp;B1, velociraptor), dog, elephantB1, giant chameleonB3, giant geckoB3, giant vultureB3, giraffeB4, hippopotamusB2, moaB5, monitor lizardB1, rhinocerosB1, small cat (cheetah, leopard), snake (constrictor, viper), or wolf. (Superscript B indicates a&nbsp;Pathﬁnder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;volume.)<br /><br />The jungle lord can have up to four animal companions, but he must divide up his eﬁective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a jungle lord with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two and- level companions, or one lst-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a jungle lord&rsquo;s effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in thejungle lord&rsquo;s service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion).<br /><br />This alters hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Hardened by Nature (Ex): At 4th level, the jungle lord's keen senses make him harder to hit and more able to withstand those blows that manage to sneak by his defenses. When unarmored and unencumbered, the jungle lord can add his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMB. In addition, the jungle lord gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC at 6th level, and every 3 ranger levels thereafter (9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th). He loses these bonuses when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.<br /><br />This ability replaces spells.<br /><br />Brachiation (Ex): At 5th level, as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to his ranger level, a jungle lord can climb with a climb speed equal to his land speed, and gains a bonus on Acrobatics checks equal to his ranger level. These rounds do not have to be consecutive.<br /><br />This ability replaces the additional favored terrain granted to rangers at 5th level. The jungle lord still gains additional favored terrains at 10th, 15th, and 18th levels.<br /><br />Inspired Moment (Ex): At 11th level, the jungle lord can have an inspired moment once per day as a free action. The jungle lord gains the following beneﬁts until the end of his next turn. His speed increases by 10 feet. He can take an extra move or swift action on his turn. He gains a +4 bonus to AC and on attack rolls, skill checks, or ability checks. Finally, he automatically conﬁrms any critical threat he scores. He can use this ability one additional time per day at 19th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.<br /><br />Strong Bond (Ex): At 12th level, the jungle lord strengthens his bond with his animal companions. The jungle lord&rsquo;s effective druid level for his animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he can immediately allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees ﬁt.<br /><br />This ability replaces camouﬂage.<br /><br />Victory Cry (Ex): At 20th level, the jungle lord&rsquo;s signature battle cry rallies his animal friends to greater combat prowess and hardiness. The jungle lord can shout his victory cry a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modiﬁer as a standard action. Each time he does so, his animal companions within 200 feet gain a +6 morale bonus on attack rolls and to AC, and all threatened critical hits made by his animal companions are automatically conﬁrmed. Furthermore, following his victory cry, the jungle lord can apply a number of animal aspects equal to his Wisdom modiﬁer when using animal focus, rather than the usual limit of one. These effects last for 1 minute.<br /><br />This ability replaces master hunter.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"SAx6wP2kTpcOMpep"}

He chooses one type of creature he has selected as a favored enemy, such as &ldquo;aberrations.&rdquo; The ranger selects one ability or feat from the adaptation list for that type (see below). A ranger can use adaptations for 10 minutes per day per ranger level he possesses. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 10-minute increments. If the adaptation requires the ranger to make a more specific choice (such as what skill to use with Skill Focus), this choice is permanent and cannot be changed.<br /><br />At 8th, 13th, and 15th-level, the ranger chooses another one of his favored enemy types and selects one adaptation from that type&rsquo;s list, as well as an additional adaptation from any one list of a creature type he&rsquo;s selected (including the one just chosen, if so desired).

Once per day, he can spend 1 hour in a wilderness area gathering herbs and other natural materials and combine them into a medicinal poultice&mdash;this hour can be integrated with the hour required for the ranger to prepare spells.<br /><br />Placing the poultice on a wound or ingesting it is a standard action; the creature receiving the poultice heals a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + the ranger&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the ranger creates one additional poultice when using this ability, to a maximum of four at 18th level.

These additional effects are supernatural effects.<br /><br />This replaces endurance.<br /><br />Sudden Onset (Ex): At 4th level, a toxic herbalist can administer a poultice he created via nature&rsquo;s mercy or poison a weapon as a swift action.

The warden can take 10 on any Survival check involving any of his favored terrains, even when in immediate danger and distracted. If the warden is not in immediate danger and distracted, he can take 20 even if the check has a penalty for failure.

These rangers, known as raven masters, eschew a ranger&rsquo;s usual connection to the natural world to form a mystic bond with their birds and to grant both animal and master a number of specialized abilities.

Outside of Cheliax, raven companions alight on the rooftops and window ledges of palaces and keeps to eavesdrop on tyrants and dictators, feeding these precious secrets to the raven master so that she can more efficiently foment and organize rebellion.<br /><br />Class Skills: A raven master adds Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand to her list of class skills. She does not gain Climb, Heal, Intimidate, Ride, or Swim as class skills.<br /><br />This alters the ranger&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Avian Empathy (Ex): A raven master&rsquo;s wild empathy affects only birds.<br /><br />This alters wild empathy.<br /><br />Raven Companion (Ex): At 4th level, a raven master earns the trust and companionship of a particularly large, powerful, and intelligent raven. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability, except that the raven master&rsquo;s effective druid level is equal to her ranger level &ndash; 3. The raven master must select a bird as her animal companion. The raven companion starts with an Intelligence score of 3 and can speak one language known by the raven master. In addition to the normal abilities an animal companion gains as the raven master increases in level, the raven companion gains the following abilities.<br /><br />This ability alters hunter&rsquo;s bond and replaces specific ranger abilities as indicated below.<br /><br />Silver Champion (Ex): At 7th level, the raven companion takes on a silvery, metallic appearance. It treats all of its natural attacks as though they were magic and silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.<br /><br />This ability replaces woodland stride.<br /><br />Mimic Figurine (Su): At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, the raven master can transform her raven companion into a token similar to a&nbsp;figurine of wondrous power. Any gear worn by the raven melds into its body as part of this transformation, but held items do not. The raven can remain in this form indefinitely, or until the raven master spends a standard action to activate the statuette as though it were a&nbsp;figurine of wondrous power.<br /><br />This ability replaces swift tracker.<br /><br />Cheat Death (Sp)&nbsp;At 12th level, once per week, when a raven companion would otherwise be slain by an attack, spell, or effect, it can turn into a&nbsp;figurine of wondrous power&nbsp;as per its mimic figurine ability as an immediate action. Once transformed this way, the raven companion cannot transform back into a raven until the raven master next prepares spells.<br /><br />This ability replaces camouflage.<br /><br />Argent Magic: A raven master casts spells as do most rangers, but her spell list is somewhat expanded from the normal options most rangers can choose from, for her association with the bards and other talented performers among the Silver Ravens allows her to add a limited number of bard spells to her spell list. These spells function as divine spells, and are cast and prepared in the same manner as her other ranger spells.<br /><br />At 6th level, the raven master selects one 1st-level bard spell of her choice and adds it to her spell list as a 1st-level ranger spell. At 9th level she does the same but for a 2ndlevel bard spell. She adds a 3rd-level bard spell at 12th level, and adds a 4th-level bard spell at 15th level.<br /><br />This ability alters the ranger&rsquo;s spellcasting.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"Z3k5qK3RuCbcCcTz"}

They use their powers to peer into the realm of the dead, and are adept at hunting those who dwell in the realm between the Material Plane and the Great Beyond, the supernatural beings Tians refer to as yokai. The yokai hunter is an archetype of the ranger class.<br /><br />Favored Yokai (Su): A yokai hunter possesses a supernatural ability to sense beings connected to the spirit world, such as kami, oni, and ghosts, and is formidable at fighting them. At 1st level, a yokai hunter gains a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against one of the following creature types (and subtypes, if applicable), which are considered yokai for the purposes of this archetype: aberration, dragon, fey, magical beast, outsider (native), and undead (incorporeal). (A GM may choose to alter this list for the purposes of her campaign.) At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, a yokai hunter may select another favored yokai from this list, gaining a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against that yokai.<br /><br />In addition, whenever a yokai hunter sees a favored yokai that is disguised or has not made its otherworldly essence known, he gains an automatic check to identify the creature as such. To make this check, a yokai hunter rolls 1d20 and adds his yokai hunter level and Charisma modifier (DC 10 + 1/2 the yokai&rsquo;s Hit Dice + the yokai&rsquo;s Cha modifier). A successful check means that the yokai hunter recognizes the creature&rsquo;s ties to the spiritual world. Regardless of whether the check is successful, a yokai hunter gains the bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against favored yokai.<br /><br />This ability replaces favored enemy. Ranger abilities that rely on a favored enemy instead rely on this ability.<br /><br />Yokai Sense (Su): At 7th level, a yokai hunter can sense yokai he has identified with his favored yokai ability as though he had blindsense out to a range of 60 feet. This ability replaces woodland stride.<br /><br />Resist Yokai (Su): At 12th level, a yokai hunter can attempt to shrug off the magical energies of a yokai. He gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws to resist the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of favored yokai. In addition, once per day as a standard action, a yokai hunter can shed an effect placed on him by a yokai as break enchantment, using his yokai hunter level as his caster level. This ability replaces camouflage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"auMDetCFPEIv5v1O"}

While in this stance, the summit sentinel&rsquo;s speed is reduced to 5 feet, she gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her natural armor, and she gains a +2 bonus to her CMD against maneuvers that would move her or knock her prone.

He drives pioneers back to civilization and strives to keep the land unspoiled.<br /><br />Strong Senses (Ex): At 1st level, a wild stalker&rsquo;s life among the wild has sharpened his senses. He gains low-light vision and a +1 bonus on Perception checks. If he already has low-light vision, he gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks instead.

That creature remains the ranger&rsquo;s focus until it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or surrenders, or until the ranger designates a new focus, whichever occurs first. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target of his focus. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2.<br /><br />At 4th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the ranger can use this ability one additional time per day. This ability replaces favored enemy.<br /><br />Terrain Bond (Ex): At 4th level, the guide forms a bond with the land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain. When in his favored terrain, the ranger grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with him, the ranger&rsquo;s allies leave no trail and can&rsquo;t be tracked. The ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires. This ability replaces hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Ranger&rsquo;s Luck (Ex): Upon reaching 9th level, once per day the guide can either reroll one of his attack rolls or force an enemy who just hit him with an attack to reroll the attack roll. The ranger must take the result of the second roll even if it is worse. A ranger can use this ability once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day at 14th and 19th levels. This ability replaces evasion.<br /><br />Inspired Moment (Ex): At 11th level, the guide can have an inspired moment once per day as a free action. The ranger gains the following benefits until the end of his next turn. His speed increases by 10 feet. He can take an extra move or swift action on his turn. He gains a +4 bonus to AC and on attack rolls, skill checks, or ability checks. Finally, he automatically confirms any critical threat he scores. He can use this ability one additional time per day at 19th level.

He gains a +4 bonus on his rerolls made with the ranger&rsquo;s luck ability, or if he forces an enemy to reroll an attack, that enemy takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the roll.

Horse lords are unparalleled mounted combatants, the envy of even the most dedicated cavalier. Though called &ldquo;horse lords&rdquo; as a generic term, these rangers are not restricted to horses for their animal companions&mdash;any creature the ranger can ride is included in these abilities. A horse lord has the following class features.<br /><br />Combat Style Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, a horse lord must choose the mounted combat style.<br /><br />Mounted Bond (Ex): At 4th level, the horse lord forms a bond with an animal he can use as a mount, which becomes his animal companion. A Medium ranger can select a camel or a horse. A small ranger can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or dog if he is at least 7th level. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger&rsquo;s effective druid level is equal to his ranger level &ndash; 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks with his animal companion mount.

Such rangers stalk the wild like shadows, creating close bonds with the wild itself instead of seeking the solace and aid of companions. While ill at ease within cities and other urban areas, they are adept at using the terrain to tactical advantage; they dart through brambles and rough terrain with uncommon grace and use the land itself to lock down enemies. A wild shadow has the following class features.<br /><br />Wild at Heart (Ex): At 1st level, a wild shadow adds only 1/2 his class level when making wild empathy checks while in urban areas, and adds only 1/4 his class level to follow or identify tracks in such areas. In non-urban settings, he is considered two levels higher when determining the bonuses for such checks. This ability alters the track and wild empathy class features.<br /><br />Favored Terrain (Ex): At 3rd level, when a wild shadow chooses a favored terrain, he cannot choose urban as the terrain type. Furthermore, at 8th level and every five levels thereafter, when he chooses a new favorite terrain type, he cannot choose the urban terrain type. This ability alters the favored terrain class feature.<br /><br />Woodland Stride (Ex): This ability functions as the 7th-level ranger class feature of the same name, but the wild shadow gains it at 4th level instead. This ability replaces the hunter&rsquo;s bond class feature.<br /><br />Unfettered Step (Ex): At 7th level, a wild shadow&rsquo;s woodland stride class feature functions in any difficult terrain within any of his favored terrains, even in areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion. This ability replaces the ranger&rsquo;s woodland stride class feature gained at 7th level.<br /><br />Harrying Attack (Ex): At 11th level, a wild shadow can use his knowledge of terrain to make shrewd attacks in combat. Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow&rsquo;s favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of his favored terrains as his harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, be he cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that his harried prey is dead, he can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour. This ability replaces the quarry class feature.<br /><br />Wild Stalker (Ex): At 14th level, a wild shadow learns to better use natural surroundings to obscure his position in combat. Whenever a wild shadow is within one of his favored terrains and a feature of that terrain grants him cover, the bonuses to AC and Reflex saves for that cover improve by 1. Additionally, while he is within one of his favored terrains, if he gains concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of either type of concealment improves by 10%. Furthermore, at 16th level and 19th level, the bonuses granted by cover increase by 1 and the miss chance increases by another 10% (maximum +3 and +30% respectively at 20th level). This ability replaces the camouflage class feature.<br /><br />Master of Terrain (Ex): At 19th level, a wild shadow can use his harrying attack against creatures other than his favored enemy or he can spend a standard action to designate up to two of his favored enemies as his harried prey instead. This ability replaces the improved quarry class feature.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"ksIbxWBoLrzhRjvv"}

Finding firearms useful for taking down large and dangerous prey, they enter the fight with the crack of black powder fire, often ranging far and wide in their safaris and searches for ever-more-dangerous denizens of the wild to track, study, appreciate&mdash;and kill. While this might strike some as going against the ranger&rsquo;s usual respect for nature and the creatures of the wild, trophy hunters understand that they are just more pieces in nature&rsquo;s grand puzzle, and that the laws of the jungle&mdash;the right to kill and feed on those weaker than you, and the need to establish dominance through cunning and bloodshed&mdash;are both their rights and their duty as the current top of the food chain.<br /><br />Improved Tracking (Ex): At 1st level, a trophy hunter gains a +2 bonus on Survival skill checks when following or identifying tracks. When he tracks, he can also attempt a Knowledge (nature) check at DC 15. On a success, the trophy hunter can discern the type and condition of any animals or magical beasts he tracks. By studying their tracks, the trophy hunter is able to identify a rough approximation of their health, maneuverability, and their general behavior as compared to the norm. This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Firearm Style: At 2nd level, a trophy hunter gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat and Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms), and can use any 1st-level gunslinger deed (page 10). At every four levels thereafter, the trophy hunter can take a grit feat or select a gunslinger deed of his level or lower, ranger&rsquo;s choice. This ability replaces all combat style feats.<br /><br />Hunter&rsquo;s Aim (Ex): At 4th level, a trophy hunter gains a specific understanding of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of his favored enemies, and his careful study of these enemies reveals the best way to hurt them. When the trophy hunter makes a firearm attack against a favored enemy, he can target touch AC in the first two range increments of his firearm. This ability stacks with other effects that increase the range increments to target touch AC, adding one range increment to the effect.

A corpse hunter has the following class features.<br /><br />Class Skills: A corpse hunter adds Knowledge (religion) to his list of class skills, and removes Knowledge (nature) from his list of class skills.<br /><br />Spells: In addition to the default spells on the ranger spell list, a corpse hunter adds the following to his list of spells at the indicated spell levels: 1st&mdash;bless water,&nbsp;detect undead,&nbsp;hide from undead,&nbsp;sanctify corpseUM, 2nd&mdash;&nbsp;halt undead, 3rd&mdash;speak with dead, 4th&mdash;searing light.<br /><br />Undead Exterminator: At 1st level, a corpse hunter must select undead as his first and only favored enemy, granting him a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks when dealing with creatures of the undead type and a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against undead. A corpse hunter does not gain additional favored enemies at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, though his favored enemy bonus against undead creatures increases by 2 at each of these levels (to a maximum bonus of +10 at 20th level).<br /><br />Disrupt Control (Su): At 5th level, a corpse hunter can infuse his attacks with divine power capable of harming an undead creature as well as its controller. As a standard action, the corpse hunter can make a single melee attack against an undead creature, or a single ranged attack against an undead creature within 30 feet. If the attack is successful, he deals 1d4 points of Charisma damage to the target undead creature in addition to normal damage. If the target undead creature is being controlled by another creature within 120 feet, the controller takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage as well; unlike the initial target, the controller may attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the corpse hunter&rsquo;s class level + the corpse hunter&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) to halve the damage she would take from this attack. A corpse hunter can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus an additional time per day at 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. The amount of Charisma damage dealt increases to 1d6 at 10th level, 1d8 at 15th level, and 2d4 at 20th level.<br /><br />Graveyard Stride (Ex): At 7th level, a corpse hunter may move easily through difficult terrain in areas where corpses are interred, such as graveyards, catacombs, crypts, or necropolises. When in such an environment, the corpse hunter may move at his normal speed without taking damage or suffering any impairment, although any magical effects and enchantments that impair movement still affect him. This ability replaces woodland stride.<br /><br />Incorporeal Armament (Su): At 8th level, a corpse hunter can channel his will into any weapon he wields, making it effective against incorporeal undead. A corpse hunter may imbue a single wielded weapon with the&nbsp;ghost touch&nbsp;special ability as a swift action, causing it to deal damage normally against incorporeal creatures. The corpse hunter may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to half his ranger level; these rounds need not be consecutive. The corpse hunter can end this ability as a free action.

Individuals such as escaped political exiles, refugees fleeing danger, and various criminals all seek the transporter&rsquo;s services. While some transporters actively work to serve justice or a political cause, others are wily opportunists filling a need and profiting from the high price that desperate people are willing to pay for safe, discrete passage.<br /><br />Trailbreaker (Ex): A transporter constantly works to obscure his trail. He increases the Survival DC to track him, or a group of which he is a part, by an amount equal to half his ranger level (minimum 1). This does not stack with similar abilities, such as a traceless operative&rsquo;s trackless ability.<br /><br />This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Plot Course (Ex): At 3rd level, a transporter can spend 1d4 hours and attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (geography) check to plot a subtle course of travel between his current location and another destination. The transporter&rsquo;s course of travel is almost never direct, as it is optimized for smuggling. Thereafter, the transporter gains a +2 bonus on initiative, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks involving traveling along his plotted course.<br /><br />At 8th level, if the transporter&rsquo;s Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 10, the bonuses increase to +4. At 13th level, if his Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 20, the bonuses increase to +6, and at 18th level, if the transporter&rsquo;s check exceeds the DC by 30, the bonuses increase to +8.<br /><br />A transporter can gain the benefits of only a single plotted course at any given time. If the transporter ever strays from the course or attempts to plot a new course for any reason, he loses the benefits of his current course immediately. A transporter can retry his Knowledge (geography) check to plot a course as long as he spends 1d4 hours each time.<br /><br />This ability replaces favored terrain.<br /><br />Smuggler&rsquo;s Bond (Ex): At 4th level, a transporter must choose his allies as his hunter&rsquo;s bond, not an animal companion. Instead of granting the transporter&rsquo;s favored enemy bonus to his allies as a move action, he instead grants his plot course bonus to his allies constantly.<br /><br />This ability alters hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Hideaway (Ex): A transporter can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 20 Survival check to create a hidden shelter, useful for staying unseen by patrols of enemy creatures. The transporter&rsquo;s shelter can hold the transporter and one additional creature for every 2 by which the transporter exceeds the DC. The created shelter incorporates scents from the local area, preventing creatures on the inside from being detected by the scent ability of creatures outside of the shelter, and vice versa. Additionally, its floor is either elevated or constructed of a different substance than the nearby ground, preventing creatures outside of the shelter from using tremorsense to detect creatures inside, and vice versa. Finally, the clever structure of the hideaway causes creatures outside of the shelter to take a &ndash;10 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures inside, as if through a 1-foot-thick wall, while only causing creatures inside to take a &ndash;2 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures outside.<br /><br />These bonuses do not apply if the enemy creatures are intimately familiar with the area in which the hideaway was built (such as an area right near their home).<br /><br />This ability replaces woodland stride.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"mRUY6FZYAHurGwYm"}

A freebooter signs on with a crew when she feels the urge to travel, and often moves to a new ship when her contract ends.<br /><br />Freebooter's Bane (Ex): At 1st level, the freebooter can, as a move action, indicate an enemy in combat and rally her allies to focus on that target. The freebooter and her allies gain a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. This ability applies only to allies who can see or hear the freebooter and who are within 30 feet of the freebooter at the time she activates this ability.

This bond allows her to spend a move action to grant her allies extra combat prowess when they work as a team. All allies within 30 feet who can see or hear the freebooter gain an additional +2 bonus on attack rolls when flanking with the freebooter or with another ally affected by this ability. This ability replaces hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Fast Swimmer (Ex): Starting at 7th level, a freebooter may swim half her speed as a move action or her normal speed as a full-round action with a successful Swim check.

Like the Queen of Dis, whom many of them admire, these rangers take to heart the lessons they&rsquo;ve learned from their vastly contrasting experiences and know that creatively embracing this wisdom is sometimes the difference between life and death.<br /><br />Class Skills: A realm wanderer adds Diplomacy and Bluff to his list of class skills, but does not gain Intimidate and Stealth as class skills.<br /><br />This alters the ranger&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Deceptive Subtlety (Ex): A realm wanderer adds half his level (minimum 1) to Diplomacy checks to influence a creature&rsquo;s attitude, to make requests of creatures, and for similar uses of the skill. He also adds half his level (minimum 1) to Bluff checks to deceive, lie, or convey secret messages.<br /><br />This replaces track.<br /><br />Queen&rsquo;s Bond (Ex): At 4th level, a realm wanderer must choose an animal companion for his hunter&rsquo;s bond. This animal companion gains the fiendish template, likely either due to time it spent near a gate to Hell or due to infernal influences in its place of birth. Due to this insidious influence, this animal companion always takes a penalty on attack rolls equal to one-fifth of the realm wanderer&rsquo;s level (minimum 1).<br /><br />If the realm wanderer releases his animal companion from service or it perishes, he can gain a new fiendish animal companion by completing the required ceremony. Alternatively, when the realm wanderer releases his animal companion or it dies in his service, he can use his influence over its fiendish nature to cause the animal to lose the fiendish template. If the animal companion is then raised or otherwise brought back from the dead after the realm wanderer removes its fiendish template, the animal companion no longer takes the penalty on attacks described above. (He cannot, however, gain a new non-fiendish animal companion by completing the ceremony to replace an animal companion.)<br /><br />This alters hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Dual Master (Ex): At 8th level, the realm wanderer&rsquo;s bonuses from deceptive subtlety are doubled when he is in either of his two favored terrain types. However, this benefit applies only to the first two favored terrain types he selected; as he gains additional favored terrains at higher levels, this benefit does not apply in those additional terrain types.<br /><br />This replaces swift tracker.<br /><br />Shrewdest Monarch (Su): At 20th level, the realm wanderer has become a true master of the territories with which he is familiar. As a standard action, he can make a single attack at his full attack bonus against an enemy in one of the terrains chosen using the dual master ability. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or die. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the realm wanderer&rsquo;s level + his Wisdom modifier. A realm wanderer can instead deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature&rsquo;s current hit points; the target can attempt a Fortitude save at the same DC to negates this damage. The realm wanderer can use this ability in these favored terrains only up to four times per day, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.<br /><br />Further, the realm wanderer gains a bonus on attack rolls equal to his Wisdom modifier against creatures that have successfully learned his alignment (using&nbsp;detect chaos/evil/good/law, as appropriate, or similar effects).<br /><br />This replaces master hunter.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"qsw6JbV9iOobF9XT"}

If her attack roll is greater than the attacking opponent&rsquo;s roll, the opponent&rsquo;s initial attack automatically misses. For each size category the attacking creature is larger than the toxophilite, the toxophilite takes a &ndash;4 penalty on her attack roll. The toxophilite must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made. Unusually massive ranged weapons, such as boulders or ballista bolts, and ranged attacks by firearms or generated by natural attacks or spell effects can&rsquo;t be deflected. This ability replaces endurance.<br /><br />Improved Intercept (Ex): At 11th level, when the toxophilite takes a full-attack action with a ranged weapon, she can choose to forgo one of her attacks. If she does so, she can use her intercept arrow ability as an immediate action instead of a readied action at any time before her next turn. Her attack roll to intercept uses the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forgo during her previous action. This ability replaces quarry.<br /><br />Greater Intercept (Ex): At 19th level, whenever a toxophilite successfully def lects an attack with her intercept arrow ability, she can redirect the attack against a target within 30 feet, using the intercepted attack&rsquo;s attack roll against the new target&rsquo;s AC. This ability replaces improved quarry.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"rV8jWPQFXZBnylJx"}

Instead of studying the traits and behaviors of a favored enemy, a wild hunter studies those of various animals, incorporating those attributes into his hunting strategy.<br /><br />Animal Focus (Su): At 1st level, as a swift action a wild hunter can take on the aspect of an animal, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated.

Of course, escape from drow society is only the beginning of a drow&rsquo;s long and fraught path to redemption, and even the kindest or most repentant drow are likely to face prejudice from most of those who recognize her origins. In addition to their rescue efforts, lantern lighters often serve as sponsors for escapees and work to create pockets of civilization where redeemed drow can live in relative peace and safety by encouraging surface dwellers to cast aside the lurking shadows of prejudice and fear.<br /><br />While the vast majority of lantern lighters are elves from Kyonin, a few non-elven members of the organization have proven themselves trustworthy and dedicated enough to join their ranks. As their efforts to spread the light to other regions beyond Kyonin grow, lantern lighters of other races are beginning to round out the order&rsquo;s numbers, particularly in areas and regions that suffer under oppressive regimes.<br /><br />Daylight: A lantern lighter treats&nbsp;daylight&nbsp;as a 3rd-level ranger spell.<br /><br />This ability alters the ranger&rsquo;s spells.<br /><br />Enhanced Vision (Ex): A lantern lighter hones his senses to better combat subterranean enemies.

Falconers begin with their companion earlier than other rangers, and have the ability to teach their companions special tricks.<br /><br />Feathered Companion (Ex): At 1st level, a falconer earns the trust and companionship of a bird of prey. The bird can be of any type of large hunting or scavenging bird (even a vulture). This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature), but the falconer must take the bird (or falcon;&nbsp;Ultimate Wildneress pg. 178) animal companion, and that companion has only half the normal hit points.<br /><br />The falconer cannot teach the bird of prey the work trick, but can teach it either the roam or distract trick for free.

He must let it roam for no more than a week.

It makes an attack roll against that enemy. On a hit, the enemy is shaken for 1 round. This ability replaces wild empathy.<br /><br />Hunter&rsquo;s Bond (Ex): At 4th level, a falconer must select an animal companion when he gains hunter&rsquo;s bond.

To perform this trick, the companion must be able to fly, and it must be outdoors or someplace with enough room for the bird to fly great distances in (a grand cathedral may have enough room, but dungeons usually do not). It spends a full-round action flying to a high vantage point, and on the next round makes a charge attack upon an enemy the falconer designates. If that charge attack hits, the bird deals 2d4 points of damage instead of 1d4 with its bite and gains a &times;4 critical modifier when making the attack.

The planar scout becomes infused with the essence of his plane of choice, taking on physical characteristics of denizens native to his chosen plane as well as the abilities listed below.<br /><br />Aligned Plane: If the planar scout selects a plane with an alignment trait, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar subtype whose alignments oppose this alignment trait. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.<br /><br />Astral Plane: Each day, the planar scout can teleport up to 5 feet per ranger level as a move action. This must be used in 5-foot increments. At 10th level, he can do so as a swift action.<br /><br />Ethereal Plane: The planar scout can damage incorporeal creatures with mundane weapons as if they were ghost touch weapons, and at 10th level, he can inflict critical hits and deal precision damage to incorporeal creatures.<br /><br />First World: As a swift action a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier, a planar scout can gain fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to his ranger level.<br /><br />Plane of Air: As a swift action, the planar scout can gain a fly speed (average) equal to his base speed for a number of minutes equal to his ranger level (minimum 1 minute). This duration need not be used consecutively.<br /><br />Plane of Earth: The planar scout gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels he gains beyond 4th level.<br /><br />Plane of Fire: As a swift action, the planar scout can wreathe his body in flames. This grants the planar scout fire resistance 5 and causes his melee attacks to each deal 1d4 additional points of fire damage. The scout&rsquo;s fire resistance increases to 10 at 9th level, and 15 at 14th level. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his level. These rounds need not be used consecutively.<br /><br />Plane of Shadow: The planar scout gains darkvision 60 feet and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks. The bonus on Stealth checks increases by 2 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter.<br /><br />Plane of Water: The planar scout gains the amphibious subtype and a swim speed equal to base speed.<br /><br />This replaces hunter&rsquo;s bond.<br /><br />Planar Adaptation (Su): At 9th level a planar scout gains planar adaptation when on his bonded plane. At 16th level he confers this protection to all allies within a 30-foot spread.<br /><br />This replaces evasion and improved evasion.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Planar Terrains</h2>\n<p>A staggering array of terrains await exploration in the Great Beyond. Some are akin to the forests, mountains, oceans, and plains of Material Plane worlds, but others are unlike anything found there, such as the ghostly reaches of the Ethereal Plane, the living and horrific reaches of the deep Abyss, the constantly burning inferno of the Plane of Fire, and the life-draining nothingness of the Negative Energy Plane.<br /><br />Some classes, like the ranger, interact directly with terrain, and class abilities like favored terrain can become complicated in a plane-hopping campaign. In games that are largely limited to the Material Plane, the planes terrain category works fine, but if you intend to run a game set on another plane, you should consider breaking up that category into specific planes (thus, a ranger would choose Heaven or Ethereal Plane, or even a demiplane like Leng as a favored terrain), or simply doing away with the planes category entirely. With this latter solution, you should work with ranger players to help them anticipate the terrains featured in your upcoming campaign, with new categories like crystalline (for realms in the Plane of Earth or under Elysium, where immense crystal formations are common), living (for truly sentient realms like portions of the Abyss), or void (for empty reaches in the Astral Plane or the energy planes) potentially becoming new options for rangers to select from.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Ranger","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG","_id":"yH26Yb6A1IdEPhac"}
