Some half-orc paladins take up these misunderstood creatures as their cause, standing up for the monstrous creatures and, when possible, leading them to the light. These paladins are called redeemers. A redeemer has the following class features.<br /><br />Merciful Smite (Su): At 1st level, when a redeemer chooses to smite a creature, she can have all of her attacks against the target deal nonlethal damage. She does not take the normal &ndash;4 attack roll penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. She cannot use this ability to deal nonlethal damage to outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, or undead creatures (these creatures take lethal damage from her smite). This otherwise works like and replaces the standard paladin&rsquo;s smite evil.<br /><br />Monstrous Rapport (Ex): At 1st level, redeemers gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence creatures who are commonly considered monstrous. This includes but is not limited to \"monstrous\" races such as goblins and orcs, monstrous humanoids, and other intelligent non-humanoid monsters. This ability replaces&nbsp;detect evil.<br /><br />Pact of Peace (Sp): At 8th level, a redeemer can force a defeated creature to accept a binding pact of peace as a condition of its surrender, as if using&nbsp;lesser geas. Her caster level for this ability is equal to her paladin level. Rather than assigning a mission or task, the redeemer gives the creature a simple set of prohibitions to protect others. Example geas include \"Leave this city and do not return\" or \"Do not attack caravans.\" The prohibition must be against an area no larger than 300 square miles or one specific group of people (such as a tribe or citizens of a particular city). This ability lasts 1 month per paladin level. This replaces aura of resolve.<br /><br />Aura of Mercy (Su): At 11th level, a redeemer can expend two uses of her merciful smite ability to grant the merciful smite ability to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses. Allies must use this merciful smite ability by the start of the paladin&rsquo;s next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benefit from this ability. This replaces aura of justice.<br /><br />Associates: A redeemer may ally with an evil creature as long as she feels the creature is capable of redemption. A redeemer may accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are not lawful good provided they demonstrate they are willing to follow her and seek betterment under her tutelage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"2ZddSXDFmiPJnCOG"}

Though they hold to the same strict paladin code, legates present themselves not as armed crusaders, but as peaceful envoys and advisors, bringing wisdom garnered from the long, stable history of their nation. They often serve as diplomats (and sometimes spies) for good organizations. Yet woe to those who believe them defenseless, for a legate can call upon her divine patron to provide her with armor and weapons.<br /><br />Celestial Armor (Sp): At 3rd level, a legate can conjure armor as a standard action. This ability acts as the spell&nbsp;instant armor (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide&nbsp;229), using her paladin level as her caster level, except as follows. At 6th level and every 3 paladin levels thereafter, the armor gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus. These bonuses can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities:&nbsp;championUE, fortification&nbsp;(heavy, light, or medium),&nbsp;invulnerability,&nbsp;or&nbsp;spell resistance&nbsp;(13, 15, 17, or 19). In addition, the legate can grant her armor the&nbsp;energy resistance&nbsp;special ability at the cost of a +3 bonus, the&nbsp;improved energy resistance&nbsp;special ability at the cost of a +5 bonus, or the&nbsp;righteousUE&nbsp;special ability at a cost of a +4 bonus. The armor must have least a +1 enhancement bonus before any special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted are determined when this ability is used and cannot be changed until this ability is used again. If the legate has a steed bond and is riding her steed, she can include her steed when summoning celestial armor, granting the steed barding with the same bonuses and special abilities as her own.

Their divergence from the paladin&rsquo;s normal code still drains them, but somehow, they have found a way to avoid losing all of their powers.<br /><br />Alignment: A gray paladin can be lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good, though she must still follow a lawful good, neutral good, or lawful neutral deity.<br /><br />This alters the paladin&rsquo;s alignment restrictions.<br /><br />Class Skills: A gray paladin adds Bluff, Disguise, and Intimidate to her list of class skills.<br /><br />This alters the paladin&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Weakened Grace: A gray paladin&rsquo;s loosened code weakens her connection to the power that grants her paladin abilities. She gains her first use of smite evil at 2nd level, instead of 1st, though she still gains further uses of smite evil at the rate listed on Table 3&ndash;11 of the&nbsp;Core Rulebook. She never gains the aura of good or divine grace class features. Her aura of courage does not make her immune to fear, her aura of resolve does not make her immune to charms, and her aura of righteousness does not make her immune to compulsions.<br /><br />This ability alters smite evil, aura of courage, aura of resolve, and aura of righteousness, and it replaces aura of good and divine grace.<br /><br />Code of Conduct: A gray paladin must be of lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good alignment and loses all class features except proficiencies if she ever willingly commits an evil act (for example, casting a spell with the evil descriptor). She should strive to act with honor and uphold the tenets of her faith, but failing to do so is not a violation of her code, and other than evil actions, she can do whatever else she feels is necessary to uphold the causes of law and good.<br /><br />This ability replaces the paladin&rsquo;s code of conduct and associated abilities and alters the section on ex-paladins.<br /><br />Enhanced Health (Ex): At 3rd level, a gray paladin is far less a stranger to poisons than a normal paladin. She gains a +4 sacred bonus on all saving throws against poisons and diseases.<br /><br />This ability replaces divine health.<br /><br />Smite Foe (Su): At 4th level, a gray paladin can spend two uses of smite evil in order to smite a nongood creature that is not evil and gain her full benefits. The gray paladin must truly believe that the creature she smites is an opponent to the cause of good. Even if this nonevil foe is an outsider, undead, or dragon, she doesn&rsquo;t add increased damage to her first attack.<br /><br />This ability replaces channel positive energy and alters smite evil.<br /><br />Aura of Subtlety (Sp, Su): At 11th level, a gray paladin learns how to protect herself from detection. She and her allies within 10 feet gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against divination effects. Furthermore, casters of divinations that target the gray paladin or her nearby allies must succeed at a caster level check as though the gray paladin and her nearby allies were under the effect of a&nbsp;nondetection&nbsp;spell cast by the gray paladin, with a caster level equal to the gray paladin&rsquo;s paladin level.

With the gifts of purity and redemption, these paladins spend much of their lives helping others find the true path. Unleashing this power takes patience and comes at a steep price. Warriors of the holy light have the following class features.<br /><br />Power of Faith (Su): At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her allies. This class feature replaces the paladin&rsquo;s spells class feature. A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items.<br /><br />At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can spend a use of her lay on hands ability to call upon the power of her faith as a standard action. This causes a nimbus of&nbsp;light&nbsp;to emanate from the warrior of the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute.<br /><br />At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies, curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell&nbsp;lesser restoration. A creature can only be healed in this way once per day.<br /><br />At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as&nbsp;daylight&nbsp;for the purposes of affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy light when this power is activated.<br /><br />At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25% chance that critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with other abilities that grant similar protection (such as&nbsp;light fortification).<br /><br />At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2. The amount of ability damage healed increases to 2d4. The energy resistance increases to 20 against one energy type. Finally, protection against critical hits increases to 50%.<br /><br />Shining Light (Su): At 14th level, a warrior of the holy light can unleash a 30-foot burst of pure, white light as a standard action. Evil creatures within this burst take 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels and are blinded for 1 round. Evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A Reflex save halves this damage and negates the blindness. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light&rsquo;s level + the warrior of the holy light&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. Good creatures within this burst are healed 1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and receive a +2 sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. A warrior of the holy light can use this ability once per day at 14th level plus one additional time per day at 17th and 20th levels.

He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier at 1st level, plus 1 additional round per day for each level beyond 1st. While his stigmata are active, he takes 1 point of bleed damage, which automatically ceases when he ends this ability but otherwise does not relent, even in the face of magical healing or Heal checks. His stigmata assist his allies, duplicating the effect of the countersong, distraction, or inspire courage bardic performance of a bard of his paladin level, though both countersong and distraction use Heal skill checks instead of Perform skill checks. At 10th level, he can choose to duplicate the effects of inspire greatness.

This ability functions only when the martyr is conscious.<br /><br />This ability replaces divine health.<br /><br />Martyr's Mercy (Su): At 3rd level, a martyr can apply any of the mercies for which he qualifies based on his paladin level to his lay on hands, even if he didn&rsquo;t select that mercy (or its prerequisites). However, when he uses a mercy he didn&rsquo;t select, he transfers the condition to himself for the remaining duration (ignoring any immunity he might have to the condition), and he can&rsquo;t use this ability if he already has that condition. If he transfers a condition to himself in this way, he can&rsquo;t remove it from himself with a personalonly ability. The martyr can use lay on hands on any ally within 30 feet, rather than needing to touch the ally, but using lay on hands on himself is a standard action, not a swift action.<br /><br />This ability alters lay on hands and mercy.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"BFkIzWkZuCeM0EDK"}

These selfless paladins believe the best way to combat evil is by bolstering the health and spirits of those who fight alongside them. They play vital roles and often command troops among martial faiths, such as those of Iomedae and Torag.<br /><br />Bestow Hope (Su): Beginning at 1st level, an invigorator is a champion of her faith who can call upon her deity&rsquo;s holy power to bathe battling allies in protective energy. As a swift action during combat, the invigorator can choose a number of nonevil allies within sight equal to her Charisma modifier upon whom to bestow hope. Once activated, bestow hope grants the invigorator and these allies DR 1/&mdash; until the combat ends, at which point the damage reduction immediately ends.<br /><br />During a battle, the invigorator can change the allies this ability affects as a swift action. Ending it is a free action, but each time it is activated during a single combat, another use of the ability is expended. The invigorator can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. The invigorator must participate in the combat to use this ability. If she is frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, any DR this ability bestows is temporarily suspended until she can participate in the combat again; this doesn&rsquo;t count as ending the ability.<br /><br />At 4th level, and at every 3 paladin levels thereafter, the DR this ability grants increases by 1, to a maximum of DR 7/&mdash; at 19th level.<br /><br />The DR this ability grants does not stack with the DR the invigorator receives from aura of righteousness or holy champion. However, at both 7th level and 20th level, an invigorator can choose to bestow hope upon an additional ally, for a total number of allies equal to 2 + the invigorator&rsquo;s Charisma modifier at 20th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Holy Fount (Su): At 11th level, an invigorator can expend two uses of bestow hope to radiate healing energies to bolster her nearby allies. For a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the invigorator&rsquo;s paladin level, the invigorator and all nonevil allies within a 10-foot radius of her gain fast healing 10. This ability is an aura centered on the invigorator; allies must be within the aura at the beginning of their turns to benefit from the fast healing. Using this ability is a free action.<br /><br />This ability replaces aura of justice.<br /><br />Champion of Life (Sp): An invigorator&rsquo;s holy resolve can sometimes overcome death&mdash;or smite the horror that is undeath.

Many of these knights are Abadarans, and some have also taken the sacred shield archetype. Regardless, knights of coins know that a prosperous city can uplift and enrich more people than pious prayers alone.<br /><br />Class Skills: A knight of coins adds Appraise, Knowledge (local), Perception, and Use Magic Device to her list of class skills. She gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + her Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />This alters the paladin&rsquo;s class skills and skill ranks per level.<br /><br />Eye for Forgeries (Sp): At will, a knight of coins can concentrate on a single item within 30 feet as a move action. When she does, the knight of coins can detect if it is magical, as per the spell&nbsp;detect magic. The knight of coins cannot concentrate on more than one item in this way at a time.<br /><br />This replaces detect evil.<br /><br />Blessing of Prosperity (Su): A knight of coins is a patron of wealth and seeks to even the playing field for those who have unfair economic disadvantages. At 3rd level and every 6 levels thereafter, the paladin can select a blessing (see Blessings below). By expending a use of lay on hands, the knight of coins can instead grant a boon to herself or a creature touched as a standard action. These boons do not stack with themselves or with blessings from another knight of coins. A blessing of prosperity lasts up to 1 hour, though the knight of coins who bestowed it can end a blessing&rsquo;s benefits early (whether it affects her or another creature) as a free action. Using this ability requires only one free hand and is a standard action, unless the knight of coins targets herself, in which case it is a swift action.<br /><br />If she knows multiple blessings of prosperity, the knight of coins can bestow multiple blessings on a single target as part of the action and the expenditure of a use of lay on hands required to use this ability. If she bestows multiple different blessings, these blessings are cumulative. For example, a 9th-level knight of coins&rsquo; blessing of prosperity ability might grant a +4 sacred bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks as well as a +4 sacred bonus on Perception checks and to CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers.<br /><br />A knight of coins who takes the Extra Mercy feat can gain an extra blessing of prosperity instead of an extra mercy. Once a blessing of prosperity is chosen, it can&rsquo;t be changed. A character who has benefited from a blessing of prosperity cannot benefit from that same blessing again (whether bestowed by the same knight of coins or another knight of coins) for 24 hours.<br /><br />Blessings: The following blessings are available to a knight of coins.<br /><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target adds an extra 10% to the gp value gained when selling off treasure (normally 50% of the item&rsquo;s original value). This blessing cannot result in selling treasure for more than 100% of its original value.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Appraise and Sense Motive checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Perception checks and to CMD against disarm and steal combat maneuvers.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +4 sacred bonus on Craft, Perform, and Profession checks.</li>\n<li>The target can use locate object as a spell-like ability once, using the knight of coins&rsquo; class level as the caster level.</li>\n<li>The target can treat one settlement as having its base value and purchase limit increased by 30%. The target must choose the affected settlement when the knight of coins bestows this blessing.</li>\n<li>The target can treat one settlement as being one size category larger for the purposes of determining available magic items.

Soul sentinels use the strength of their resolve to stem the tide of corruption and insanity, as they believe that the greatest tragedy is a soul lost to evil when it was within their power to save it.<br /><br />Reprieve (Su): A soul sentinel relieves manic and tortured souls exposed to the harsh evil of the world.

As a swift action, she treats her melee attacks until the beginning of her next turn (whether armed or unarmed) as magical and adamantine, including ignoring hardness up to twice her paladin level, with a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls, as well as on combat maneuver checks. This bonus also applies to her CMD if she or her target is touching the ground or a stone structure. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. This ability replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Heartstone (Ex): At 2nd level, a stonelord&rsquo;s flesh becomes progressively rockier. She gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC and DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 her paladin level. The natural armor bonus increases by +1 at 6th level, and every four levels thereafter, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These benefits are halved when not touching the ground or a stone structure. This ability replaces divine grace.<br /><br />Stoneblood (Ex): At 3rd level, a stonelord&rsquo;s vitals begin to calcify and her blood transforms into liquid stone. She adds her paladin level on checks to stabilize at negative hit points and gains a 25% chance to ignore a critical hit or precision damage. This does not stack with&nbsp;fortification&nbsp;armor or similar effects. At 9th level, this chance increases to 50% and she becomes immune to petrification. At 15th level, this chance increases to 75% and she becomes immune to bleed and blood drain effects.

Levels of stalwart defender stack with her paladin levels when determining the total number of rounds that she can maintain her defensive stance per day. A stonelord does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items.<br /><br />Earth Channel (Su): At 4th level, a stonelord gains Elemental Channel (earth) as a bonus feat, which she may activate by spending two uses of her lay on hands ability, using her paladin level as her effective cleric level. This ability replaces channel positive energy.<br /><br />Stone Servant (Su): At 5th level, a stonelord may call a Small earth elemental to her side, as a paladin calls her mount.

Good-aligned dragons are more likely to treat such paladins as they would treat other dragons (though perhaps not with the respect reserved for other true dragons), and evil dragons often target them as special threats.<br /><br />More rarely a drake is so inspired by a paladin of Apsu that it chooses to assist the paladin in all her actions. These drake allies see the benefit of a silver champion remaining mobile and understand the powerful threats the champion must face, and in time even consent to serve their chosen paladins as a steed. Silver champions are often concerned by their drake allies&rsquo; pragmatic natures, however, and are sure to treat them with respect, knowing that these lesser dragons must constantly be inspired to act on their better natures.<br /><br />Deity: A silver champion must worship Apsu.<br /><br />Drake Mount&nbsp;: At 5th level, a silver champion gains a drake companion. If the drake companion is at least one size larger than the silver champion, it gains the mount drake power as a bonus power. However, a silver champion doesn&rsquo;t gain additional uses per day of smite evil at 4th, 10th, and 16th levels, and doesn&rsquo;t gain mercies at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.<br /><br />This ability replaces divine bond, channel energy, aura of justice, and aura of righteousness, and alters smite evil and mercy.<br /><br />Dragon Magic&nbsp;: The silver champion does not have access to the normal paladin spell list. She instead adds the 1stthrough 4th-level spells from the domains granted by Apsu (Artifice, Good, Law, Scalykind, Travel) and the god&rsquo;s associated subdomains (Archon, Construct, Dragon, Exploration, Toil, and Trade) to her class spell list.

These sacred servants are rewarded for their devotion with additional spells and powerful allies. A sacred servant must select one deity to worship. This deity&rsquo;s alignment must be lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good. A sacred servant has the following class features.<br /><br />Smite Evil (Su): This functions as the paladin ability, but the sacred servant can smite evil one additional time per day at 7th level, and every six levels thereafter (instead of 4th level and every three levels thereafter). This replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Spells: At 4th level, when a sacred servant gains the ability to cast spells, she also chooses one domain associated with her deity. Her effective cleric level for this domain is equal to her paladin level &ndash;3. In addition, she also gains one domain spell slot for each level of paladin spells she can cast. Every day she must prepare the domain spell from her chosen domain in that spell slot.<br /><br />Divine Bond (Su): At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred servant forms a bond with her holy symbol. As a standard action, a sacred servant can bind a celestial spirit to her holy symbol for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the sacred servant&rsquo;s holy symbol to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants one bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the spirit grants one additional bonus. These bonuses can be spent in a number of ways to grant the paladin enhanced abilities to channel positive energy and to cast spells. Each bonus can be used to grant one of the following enhancements: +1 caster level to any paladin spell cast, +1 to the DC to halve the damage of channel positive energy when used to harm undead, +1d6 to channel positive energy, +1 use/day of lay on hands. These enhancements stack and can be selected multiple times. The enhancements granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.<br /><br />If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the sacred servant takes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.<br /><br />Call Celestial Ally (Sp): At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant. This allows the sacred servant to cast&nbsp;lesser planar ally&nbsp;once per week as a spell-like ability without having to pay the material component cost or the servant (for reasonable tasks). At 12th level, this improves to&nbsp;planar ally&nbsp;and at 16th level, this improves to&nbsp;greater planar ally. The sacred servant&rsquo;s caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin level.

Her allies must remain within 10 feet of her, and must be able both to see and hear the divine hunter to gain this benefit.

Valor, justice, and honor are their lifeblood, and they would sooner cut out their own hearts than betray their comrades and faith. A sword of valor has the following class features.<br /><br />Iomedae Worshiper: A sword of valor must have Iomedae as a patron deity.<br /><br />First Into Battle (Su): At 2nd level, a sword of valor can spend 1 use of smite evil or lay on hands to act in the surprise round, even if she is surprised. When the paladin makes an Initiative check, she gains a bonus to the check equal to her Charisma bonus. This ability replaces divine grace.<br /><br />Prayer of the Fourth Act (Su): At 6th level, by spending 1 minute leading a prayer to Iomedae, the sword of valor can spend one use of channel energy to give living creatures in the channel burst temporary hit points equal to the amount that ability normally heals. These temporary hit points last for no more than 1 hour. This replaces the paladin&rsquo;s mercy gained at 6th level.<br /><br />Worthy Enemy (Su): At 11th level, when a sword of valor critically hits an enemy with a smite, the target must make a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the paladin&rsquo;s level + the paladin&rsquo;s Charisma bonus) or be compelled to surrender to the paladin, as if affected by a&nbsp;suggestion&nbsp;spell (CL = the paladin&rsquo;s level) to lay down arms and give up the fight. An enemy that succumbs to this ability remains docile until it is injured by the paladin or one of his obvious allies, at which point the compulsion to surrender immediately ends and the enemy is free to make his own choices again. If the enemy makes the save, it is not subject to this ability for 24 hours. Worthy enemy is a mind-affecting effect.

She does not gain access to divine spellcasting and cannot use spell-completion magic items.<br /><br />Divine Troth (Sp): Once per day the divine guardian pledges her protection to a willing creature for the day. This is done at the same time she prepares her spells. When the paladin first selects a creature for divine troth, that creature must be present and agree to receive the paladin&rsquo;s protection, but if the paladin already has a creature selected for divine troth, she can maintain that selection each day without her charge being present.

She does deal 2 points of damage per level on all smite attacks made against evil undead creatures.<br /><br />Aura of Life (Su): At 8th level, an undead scourge emits a 10-foot aura of life around her that weakens undead creatures. Undead in this aura take a &ndash;4 penalty on Will saves made to resist positive energy. In addition, undead in this aura do not regain hit points from channeled negative energy. This ability replaces aura of resolve.<br /><br />Undead Annihilation (Su): At 11th level, an undead scourge can expend one use of her smite evil ability as a standard action and make a single melee attack against an undead creature. If this attack hits, the undead creature must make a Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the undead scourge&rsquo;s level + the undead scourge&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.

Her place is at their side against overwhelming odds, and her guidance brings out their true potential.<br /><br />Weal&rsquo;s Champion (Su): Once per day as swift action, a holy tactician can call on the powers of good to aid her against evil. Against evil targets, the holy tactician gains her Charisma bonus (if any) on her attack rolls against evil creatures, and if she hits, she adds 1/2 her paladin level on her weapon damage rolls as well. These bonuses last for 1 round for every two paladin levels the holy tactician has attained (minimum 1 round).<br /><br />In addition, for 1 round after the holy tactician successfully strikes an evil creature, all non-evil allies within 30 feet of her gain a competence bonus on attack rolls equal to 1/2 her Charisma bonus against that creature as well as a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls. The bonus on damage rolls increases by +1 for every five levels the holy tactician attains (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). She can grant this bonus against more than one creature at a time. To gain this benefit, the holy tactician&rsquo;s allies must be able to see or hear her, and she must be conscious.<br /><br />At 4th level, and every three levels thereafter, the holy tactician may use weal&rsquo;s champion one additional time per day (to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level). This ability replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Tactical Acumen (Ex): At 3rd level, a holy tactician gains a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat. She gains an additional bonus feat for every four levels attained after 3rd, to a maximum of five bonus feats at 19th level. This ability replaces divine health and divine bond.<br /><br />Battlefield Presence (Su): At 3rd level, a tactician can direct her allies in battle, granting each ally within 30 feet one teamwork feat she possesses as a bonus feat as a standard action. All allies must receive the same feat, but do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. This ability does not function if the paladin is flat-footed or unconscious. Allies must be able to see and hear the holy tactician in order to gain this benefit. Changing the bonus feat granted is a swift action. This ability replaces aura of courage.<br /><br />Guide the Battle (Ex): At 8th level, the paladin can direct her allies into an advantageous position once per round as a move action. Each ally (if physically able to) can move 5 feet without expending an action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The allies must be able to see or hear the paladin in order to make this movement and cannot be flat-footed. At 15th level, her allies can make this 5-foot move and ignore difficult terrain. This ability replaces aura of resolve.<br /><br />Weal&rsquo;s Wrath (Su): At 11th level, a tactician can expend two uses of her weal&rsquo;s champion ability at once to enhance its effects. This functions as weal&rsquo;s champion, except the bonus she provides to her allies lasts until each creature she strikes is slain, her weal&rsquo;s champion ability expires, or the paladin herself is slain or knocked unconscious, whichever happens first. This ability replaces aura of justice.<br /><br />Masterful Presence (Su): At 20th level, a tactician gains the ability to grant a different bonus feat to each ally affected by her battlefield presence.

Irori offers no universal paladin code&mdash; each paladin in his service creates his own code as part of his spiritual journey, seeing the adherence to such a self-formulated creed as one of the many tests one must face to reach perfection.<br /><br />Skills: An Iroran paladin gains Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim as class skills.<br /><br />Confident Defense (Ex): At 1st level, when wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, an Iroran paladin adds 1 point of his Charisma bonus (if any) per class level to his Dexterity bonus to his Armor Class. If he is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied his Dexterity bonus, he also loses this bonus. This ability replaces his proficiency with medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.<br /><br />Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, an Iroran paladin gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. In addition, he gains the unarmed strike monk ability, treating his monk level as half his paladin level (minimum 1) for calculating his unarmed strike damage.<br /><br />Aura of Law (Su): The power of an Iroran paladin&rsquo;s aura of law is equal to his class level. This ability replaces aura of good.<br /><br />Sense Perfection (Su): At 1st level, at will, an Iroran paladin can detect life forces as if he were using a paladin&rsquo;s detect evil class ability; however, instead of sensing evil creatures, he senses creatures that have a ki pool. Each such creature has an aura like a cleric of an aligned deity, and treats its current number of ki points as its Hit Dice for the purposes of this ability. This ability replaces detect evil.<br /><br />Personal Trial (Su): Once per day, an Iroran paladin can as a swift action declare one target within line of sight as his personal trial. The Iroran paladin gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that creature, to his AC against attacks made by the target, and on saving throws against the target&rsquo;s spells and special abilities. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum bonus of +6 at 20th level. The personal trial effect remains until the target of the trial is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains daily uses of this ability. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the Iroran paladin can use personal trial one additional time per day. This ability replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Aura of Excellence (Su): At 3rd level, an Iroran paladin is immune to any effect that would force him to reroll a die against his will or roll twice and take the lower result. Whenever an ally within 10 feet of him would reroll a die against her will, she can roll twice and take the higher result. Whenever an ally within 10 feet would be forced to roll twice and take the lower result, she can instead roll three times and take the second-lowest result. This ability functions only while the Iroran paladin is conscious, and replaces aura of courage.<br /><br />Ki Pool (Su): At 4th level, an Iroran paladin gains a ki pool with an effective monk level equal to his class level. The number of points in an Iroran paladin&rsquo;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his class level + his Charisma modifier. By spending 1 point from his ki pool, he can ignore any damage reduction possessed by the target of his personal trial ability for 1 round. This ability otherwise functions as the monk ability of the same name and replaces channel positive energy.<br /><br />Divine Body (Su): Upon reaching 5th level, an Iroran paladin must form a bond with a weapon, except he can only choose to enhance his unarmed strike. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces divine bond.<br /><br />Aura of Perfection (Su): At 11th level, whenever an Iroran paladin or ally within 10 feet would reroll a die and take the second result even if it is lower (via the good fortune ability of the Luck domain, for example), he can roll an additional die as part of the reroll and use the higher of the two as the result of the reroll.

Such a vindictive bastard, as these fallen paladins are known, strikes out for retribution and revenge, far more interested in tearing down those who have harmed her or her companions than furthering a distant deity&rsquo;s cause.<br /><br />This is an ex-class archetype and can be taken by a character immediately upon becoming an ex-paladin.<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>EX-CLASS ARCHETYPES</h3>\n<p>The following archetype can be taken by an ex-paladin immediately upon becoming an ex-paladin, regardless of character level, replacing some or all of the lost class abilities. If another archetype the character had before she became an ex-paladin replaces the same ability as the ex-class archetype, she loses the old archetype in favor of the new one; otherwise, she can retain both archetypes as normal. Vindictive bastards can gain further levels in the paladin class, even though becoming an ex-paladin normally prohibits further advancement in the class. While an ex-member of a class can recant her failings and atone for her fall from her original class (typically involving an&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;spell), her acceptance of her ex-class archetype means she must atone both for her initial fall and for further straying from the path. As a result, such a character must be the target of two&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;spells or a similar effect to regain her lost class features. Upon doing so, she immediately loses this archetype and regains her original class (and archetype, if she had one).<br /><br />No Aura: A vindictive bastard does not radiate an alignment aura.<br /><br />This alters the paladin&rsquo;s aura.<br /><br />Locate Ally (Sp): Once per day, a vindictive bastard can cast&nbsp;locate creature&nbsp;as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her paladin level, but she can do so only to target an ally whom she has spent at least 24 hours in close proximity to within the last week.<br /><br />This replaces detect evil.<br /><br />Vindictive Smite (Ex): A vindictive bastard is particularly ruthless against those who have harmed her or her allies. Once per day as a swift action, she can smite one target within sight who has dealt hit point damage to her or an ally. She adds her Charisma modifier to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to damage rolls against the target of her smite. In addition, while vindictive smite is in effect, the vindictive bastard gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) to her AC against attacks by the target of the smite. If the target of vindictive smite has rendered an ally of the vindictive bastard unconscious or dead within the last 24 hours, the bonus on damage rolls on the first attack that hits increases by 2 for every paladin level she has.<br /><br />The vindictive smite effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the vindictive bastard rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the vindictive bastard can invoke her vindictive smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.<br /><br />This replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Faded Grace (Ex): At 2nd level, a vindictive bastard gains one of the following as a bonus feat: Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or Lightning Reflexes.<br /><br />This replaces divine grace.<br /><br />Solo Tactics (Ex): At 2nd level, a vindictive bastard gains solo tactics, as per the inquisitor class feature. She can activate this ability as a swift action and gains the benefits of it for 1 round. She can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to half her paladin level + her Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This replaces lay on hands.<br /><br />Spiteful Tenacity (Ex): At 3rd level, whenever a vindictive bastard has a vindictive smite in effect, she gains the benefits of the Diehard feat.<br /><br />This replaces divine health.<br /><br />Teamwork Feat: At 3rd level and every 6 levels thereafter, the vindictive bastard gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as teamwork feats. The vindictive bastard must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.<br /><br />This replaces mercy and channel energy.<br /><br />Gang Up (Ex): At 5th level, a vindictive bastard forms a close bond with her companions. This allows her to spend a move action to grant half her vindictive smite bonus against a single target to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the vindictive bastard&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />This replaces divine bond.<br /><br />Swift Justice (Ex): At 11th level, a vindictive bastard can activate her gang up ability as a swift action.<br /><br />This replaces aura of justice.<br /><br />Stalwart (Ex): At 14th level, a vindictive bastard gains stalwart, as per the inquisitor class feature, except she can also benefit from this ability while wearing heavy armor.<br /><br />This replaces aura of faith.<br /><br />Aura of Self-Righteousness (Ex): At 17th level, a vindictive bastard gains DR 5/lawful or good and immunity to compulsion spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects. Aura of self-righteousness functions only while the vindictive bastard is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.<br /><br />This replaces aura of righteousness.<br /><br />Ultimate Vindication (Ex): At 20th level, if a foe kills one of a vindictive bastard&rsquo;s allies or knocks the vindictive bastard unconscious (and she later regains consciousness), the vindictive bastard musters a vindictive fury. The next time she hits that foe within 1 minute, the vindictive bastard can channel the effects of a&nbsp;disintegrate&nbsp;spell through her weapon, using her paladin level as her effective caster level. Whether or not the target succeeds at its save against the disintegrate effect, it is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.<br /><br />This replaces holy champion.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"YtDBTf696jnLxIjF"}

She also gains a battered gun identical to the one gained by the gunslinger. This ability replaces detect evil.<br /><br />Divine Deed: At 2nd level, the holy gun gains the following deed. This deed works and interacts with grit the same way as gunslinger deeds, but only the holy gun can use it. If the holy gun also has levels in gunslinger, she can spend grit points from that class to use this deed.<br /><br />Smiting Shot (Su): A holy gun can spend 1 grit point to make a smiting shot with a firearm attack as a standard action. If the target is evil, the holy gun adds her Charisma bonus and her paladin level to the damage of the firearm attack. If the target of the smiting shot is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage increases to the Charisma modifier plus 2 points of damage per level the paladin possess. Regardless of the target, smiting shot automatically bypasses any DR the creature might have. This ability replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Divine Bond: At 5th level, a holy gun forms a bond with her deity. This functions as the paladin&rsquo;s divine bond ability, except the bond must always take the form of a firearm. In addition to the listed abilities, a holy gun can add the&nbsp;distance,&nbsp;reliable, or&nbsp;seeking&nbsp;special abilities to her weapon, but she cannot add the&nbsp;defending&nbsp;or&nbsp;disruption&nbsp;special abilities. This ability replaces the standard paladin&rsquo;s divine bond.<br /><br />Holy Grit (Ex): At 11th level, a holy gun gains a number of grit points equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) and gains the use of a single gunslinger deed. She can select any deed that a gunslinger of her paladin level &ndash;4 could use. At 14th level, and every three levels beyond 14th, the holy gun gains another point of grit and another gunslinger deed that a gunslinger of her level &ndash;4 could use. If she already has levels in gunslinger, she gains a bonus to the maximum amount of grit she can have each day, equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) but gains no extra grit as the start of each day.<br /><br />Holy Slinger (Ex): This ability function like the holy champion paladin class feature, but the&nbsp;banishment&nbsp;occurs when she hits an evil outsider with the smiting shot deed.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"dtP8xUGFkgXpMVc5"}

The chaos knight is able to tap into the nature of the Maelstrom in order to grant or gain small, unpredictable blessings to aid on her quest for order. The following archetype is available to ganzi characters.<br /><br />Entropic Touch (Su): At 2nd level, a chaos knight can employ the forces of entropy with a touch to shatter a mind-affecting spell or effect currently affecting an ally. As a standard action, he can touch a creature to grant that creature a new saving throw against one mind-affecting effect, with a bonus on the save equal to one-third the chaos knight&rsquo;s level (minimum +0). If the chaos knight targets himself, he can use this ability as a swift action. A chaos knight can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half his paladin level + his Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This replaces lay on hands.<br /><br />Blessings of the Maelstrom (Su): At 3rd level, a chaos knight can harness the unpredictable essence of the Maelstrom to bless a creature. When he uses his entropic touch ability, the chaos knight can grant the touched creature a blessing from the table below that lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the chaos knight&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Only one creature can have this blessing at a time. If another creature gains the blessing, the previous blessing ends. The creature rolls 1d4 and compares the result to the table below to determine the blessing. If the chaos knight targets himself with the blessing, he can roll twice and choose his preferred result.<br /><br />At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the chaos knight can grant a blessing to one additional creature at a time.<br /><br />This replaces mercy.<br /><br />Aura of Chaos (Su): At 14th level, a chaos knight treats his weapons as chaos-aligned for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. In addition, the chaos knight treats attacks targeting enemies within 10 feet of him as chaos-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br /><br />This replaces aura of faith.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>D4</td>\n<td>Blessing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The creature gains a sacred bonus to AC equal to 1/5 the paladin&rsquo;s level (minimum +1).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>The creature gains a sacred bonus on weapon damage rolls equal to the chaos knight&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>The creature gains fast healing 2.

The familiar is treated as having a number of ranks in Knowledge (religion) equal to the chosen one&rsquo;s paladin level. The chosen one doesn&rsquo;t gain Knowledge (religion) as a class skill.<br /><br />Delayed Grace (Su): A chosen one begins her adventuring career without fully understanding her true potential. The chosen one uses the Barbarian, Rogue, Sorcerer column on Table 7&ndash;1 on page 169 of the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook&nbsp;to calculate her typical starting age. She receives the smite evil ability at 2nd level and the divine grace ability at 4th level. This does not affect the rate at which she gains additional uses per day of smite evil, so she still gains her second use at 4th level, her third at 7th level, and so on. This ability alters divine grace and smite evil.<br /><br />Lay on Paws (Su): At 2nd level, a chosen one&rsquo;s familiar is able to borrow some of her divine energy to heal itself and others. The familiar can use the chosen one&rsquo;s lay on hands ability, including all of her mercies, but each such use consumes two uses of the paladin&rsquo;s lay on hands ability. Starting at 4th level, the familiar can also channel positive energy, but each such use consumes four uses of the paladin&rsquo;s lay on hands ability. This ability alters lay on hands and channel positive energy.<br /><br />True Form (Ex): At 7th level, a chosen one&rsquo;s familiar reveals its true form, transforming into an outsider improved familiar that matches the chosen one&rsquo;s patron&rsquo;s alignment (typically an arbiter, a cassisian, a harbinger, or a silvanshee, but potentially any lawful neutral, lawful good, or neutral good outsider familiar depending on the patron). The familiar gains the change shape universal monster ability if it doesn&rsquo;t already have it, which it can use at will to transform into its original form or back to its true form.<br /><br />Emissary&rsquo;s Smite (Su): At 11th level, a chosen one&rsquo;s familiar also benefits from the paladin&rsquo;s smite evil ability whenever the chosen one uses smite evil.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"gjHAc1385gw4rWjp"}

A tranquil guardian gains the following class features.<br /><br />Touch of Serenity (Su): At 1st level, a tranquil guardian gains Touch of Serenity as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, and every six levels thereafter, the duration of a tranquil guardian&rsquo;s Touch of Serenity increases by 1 round. Each round on its turn, the target may attempt a new Will save to end the effect. The duration does not stack; only the longest remaining duration applies.

This ability replaces aura of courage.<br /><br />Divine Bond (Su): A tranquil guardian who chooses a weapon as her divine bond may only increase her weapon&rsquo;s enhancement bonus or add the following properties to her weapon:&nbsp;conductive,&nbsp;defending,&nbsp;disruptive,&nbsp;grayflame&nbsp;, or&nbsp;merciful.<br /><br />Aura of Calm (Su): At 8th level, a tranquil guardian is immune to all spells and spell-like abilities with the emotion descriptor, as well as all fear effects.

This ability replaces aura of justice.<br /><br />Apostle of Peace (Su): At 20th level, a tranquil guardian&rsquo;s DR increases to 10/evil, and whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal, she heals the maximum possible amount. In addition, any creature struck by her Touch of Serenity, even if it saves, must make an additional Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her tranquil guardian level + her Charisma modifier) the next time it tries to attack.

{"name":"Paladin (Sacred Shield)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Combat pg. 65</a><br />When faced by evil, the sacred shield reaches first not for a weapon, but for her trusty shield. With her faith, she can ward others from harm.<br /><br />Bastion of Good (Su): At 1st level, a sacred shield can call upon the powers of good to defend her and her allies against evil. This ability functions as smite evil, except that the paladin gains no benefit on attack or damage rolls against her target. Instead, any attacks the target makes against allies within 10 feet of the paladin deal half damage. Attacks against the paladin deal full damage, but the paladin gains a deflection bonus to her AC equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) against attacks made by the target of the smite. This bonus increases by +1 for every four paladin levels (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level). As with smite evil, if the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, her bastion of good ability is wasted with no effect. Feats, abilities, and the like that increase a paladin&rsquo;s number of uses of smite evil per day increase a sacred shield&rsquo;s uses of bastion of good per day. This ability replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Holy Shield (Su): At 4th level, a sacred shield can channel her faith into her shield, protecting any nearby allies. All allies adjacent to the paladin gain a shield bonus equal to the sacred shield&rsquo;s own shield bonus, including any increase from the shield&rsquo;s enhancement bonus. This bonus does not stack with any existing shield bonuses. The paladin herself radiates light as a&nbsp;light&nbsp;spell while the shielding is active. At 11th level, this protection expands to cover any allies within 10 feet and the radiance increases to the effects of a&nbsp;daylight&nbsp;spell. At 20th level, any allies within 20 feet are protected. Using this ability consumes two uses of the sacred shield&rsquo;s lay on hands ability, and the effects last for 3 rounds plus a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (if any). This ability replaces channel positive energy.<br /><br />Divine Bond (Su): At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred shield forms a bond with her shield. As a standard action, a sacred shield can enhance her shield by calling on the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the shield to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the shield a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the shield gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the shield, stacking with existing enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities:&nbsp;arrow deflection,&nbsp;bashing,&nbsp;blinding,&nbsp;fortification&nbsp;(any),&nbsp;reflecting, and&nbsp;spell resistance&nbsp;(any). The&nbsp;reflecting&nbsp;enhancement may be used once each time the sacred shield makes use of her divine bond. Adding these armor special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property&rsquo;s cost. These bonuses are added to any properties the shield already has, but duplicate special abilities do not grant any extra benefit. If the shield is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the shield is used by anyone other than the sacred shield, but it resumes giving bonuses if the sacred shield resumes using the shield. A sacred shield can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a maximum of four times per day at 17th level.<br /><br />If a shield with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred shield loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this period, the sacred shield takes a &ndash;1 penalty to her armor class and on saving throws.<br /><br />Improved Bastion: At 11th level, the radius of a sacred shield&rsquo;s bastion of good ability increases to 20 feet. This ability replaces the paladin&rsquo;s aura of justice.<br /><br />Perfect Bastion: At 20th level, a sacred shield and her allies within 20 feet gain regeneration 10 against the target of her bastion of good ability (essentially regeneration that is overcome by any damage not caused by the target). This ability replaces the sacred shield&rsquo;s holy champion ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"kXKQWUZxbV9FENQm"}

Talmandor is reluctant to act directly on behalf of the Eagle Knights and even more unwilling to accept their worship, preferring to lend assistance primarily by being a voice of reason and dispensing wise counsel when it is most needed. A scion of Talmandor attempts to exemplify this selfless altruism, offering assistance to the oppressed and facilitating the peaceful transfer of power from the few to the many.<br /><br />Scions of Talmandor look to the brutality of the revolution in Galt, Andoran&rsquo;s neighbor, as a cautionary tale and an unfortunate blemish on populism&rsquo;s short history. They also reject the Nirmathi notion of freedom, thinking it too individualistic; instead, they strive to build strong communities both at home and abroad. Wherever possible, a scion of Talmandor opts for peaceful, grassroots solutions to problems facing the many oppressed peoples of the Inner Sea region, encouraging them to take a central role in bettering their lot in life.<br /><br />Scion&rsquo;s Faith (Ex): A scion of Talmandor must worship a lawful good deity, and she gains Fly as a class skill instead of Ride.<br /><br />This alters class skills.<br /><br />Egalitarian (Su): At 2nd level, once per day as a swift action, a scion of Talmandor can halve her bonus on saving throws from divine grace (minimum +1) to grant the resulting bonus to herself and to all allies within 30 feet. This shared bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the scion&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, after which her divine grace is suppressed for 1 hour before returning to normal.<br /><br />This ability alters divine grace.<br /><br />Bonded Eagle (Sp): At 5th level, a scion of Talmandor forms a bond with an eagle using the statistics for a bird animal companion. The eagle is a loyal companion that accompanies the scion on her adventures. When the scion activates smite evil, she can expend an additional use of smite evil to grant her eagle the bonuses granted from smite evil as well. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability, using the scion&rsquo;s paladin level as her effective druid level.<br /><br />This ability replaces divine bond.<br /><br />Consensus (Ex): At 8th level, twice per day as a swift action during the first full round of combat, a scion of Talmandor can take a vote from a number of allies equal to or less than 3 + the scion&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, all of whom must be within 30 feet of the scion of Talmandor. In initiative order, each ally can vote for Freedom, Justice, or Responsibility. Allies who vote receive a +2 sacred bonus either on attack rolls (if Justice wins), on saving throws (if Freedom wins), or to Armor Class (if Responsibility wins) until the end of combat. The scion of Talmandor votes last, and in the case of a tie, her vote breaks the tie.<br /><br />This ability replaces aura of resolve.<br /><br />Talmandor&rsquo;s Gift (Sp): At 11th level, a scion of Talmandor can summon an avoral agathion (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 16) as if via&nbsp;summon monster VII&nbsp;(caster level equals the scion&rsquo;s character level).<br /><br />This ability replaces aura of justice.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"lAc28NfBIGnUgjf1"}

However, it damages any evil outsider, not only those with the evil subtype (including native outsiders).<br /><br />This modifies smite evil.<br /><br />Banishing Smite (Su): At 3rd level, once per day when the banishing warden confirms a critical hit against a target of her smite evil effect, she can attempt to forcibly banish the target to its home plane.

This ability counts as having the Weapon Finesse feat for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites.<br /><br />Bravo&rsquo;s Smite (Su): When using smite evil, a virtuous bravo doesn&rsquo;t gain a deflection bonus to AC.<br /><br />This ability alters smite evil.<br /><br />Nimble (Ex): At 3rd level, a virtuous bravo gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light armor or no armor. Anything that causes the virtuous bravo to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes her to lose this dodge bonus.

She gains Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (planes), Perception, Stealth, and Survival as class skills but doesn&rsquo;t gain Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Knowledge (nobility), or Ride as class skills. A faithful wanderer gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + her Intelligence modifier at each level (instead of gaining a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + her Intelligence modifier).<br /><br />This alters the paladin&rsquo;s class skills and replaces detect evil.<br /><br />Hidden Aura (Su): A faithful wanderer doesn&rsquo;t have an aura of good like other paladins do, as this would give her presence away to hostile denizens of the Abyssal wastelands. Her other auras likewise don&rsquo;t reveal her presence. The benefits of her aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness affect only her. At 3rd level, her alignment aura emulates the alignment planar traits (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide&nbsp;187) of her current location (chaotic evil in the Worldwound or the Abyss) for the purposes of alignment-detection effects, though this doesn&rsquo;t change her actual alignment. At 8th level, she takes no penalties from the mildly chaos-aligned and mildly evil-aligned planar traits and treats all opposed strongly aligned planar traits as if they were only mildly aligned. At 11th level, she takes no penalties even in areas with strongly chaos- and evil-aligned planar traits. At 14th level, she leaves no trail in areas with chaos- and evil-aligned planar traits, can&rsquo;t be tracked in such terrain, and can use Stealth to hide in such terrain, even if the terrain doesn&rsquo;t grant cover or concealment. At 17th level, she can use Stealth to hide in areas with these planar traits even while being observed.<br /><br />This replaces aura of good and aura of justice, and it alters aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness.<br /><br />Stalk Evil (Su): A faithful wanderer isn&rsquo;t interested in going out in a blaze of glory after exhausting a limited ability to smite evil. Instead, she has developed techniques to evade, stalk, and punish evil whenever necessary. She gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks against evil outsiders, as well as a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. These bonuses don&rsquo;t stack with favored enemy bonuses. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 2 (to a maximum of +10 at 20th level). At 7th level, the faithful wanderer also gains these bonuses against undead, and at 13th level, she also gains these bonuses against evil dragons.<br /><br />This replaces smite evil.<br /><br />Champion&rsquo;s Bond (Su): At 5th level, a faithful wanderer must choose the weapon option of her divine bond class feature. At 20th level, whenever her divine bond is active, she gains several additional benefits, as follows: Her DR improves to 5/&mdash;. Additionally, if she rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll against an evil outsider and confirms the critical hit, the outsider is also subject to banishment, using the faithful wanderer&rsquo;s paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates).

These defenders spend their lives protecting others and taking on foes that the common man should not even know exist. To aid them in their holy mission, they have special powers to protect themselves and those around them. The divine defender has the following class features.<br /><br />Shared Defense (Su): At 3rd level, a divine defender can spend one use of her lay on hands ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including paladins) a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC and CMD and on their saving throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the divine defender&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within this area are automatically stabilized. At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. This ability does not stack with the chance provided from the light, medium, or heavy&nbsp;fortification&nbsp;armor special abilities. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This ability replaces mercy.<br /><br />Divine Bond (Su): At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor. As a standard action, a divine defender can enhance her armor by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses to a maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following armor properties (asterisks note new armor properties found in Chapter 7):&nbsp;champion*,&nbsp;ghost touch,&nbsp;heavy fortification,&nbsp;invulnerability,&nbsp;light fortification,&nbsp;moderate fortification,&nbsp;spell resistance&nbsp;(13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property&rsquo;s cost (see Table 15&ndash;4 of the&nbsp;Core Rulebook). In addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties:&nbsp;energy resistance&nbsp;for +3 bonus,&nbsp;improved energy resistance&nbsp;for +5 bonus, or&nbsp;righteous* for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.<br /><br />If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the divine defender takes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"qD7a1HG9jEZ5OrZl"}

Whenever a fire spell would affect a creature within the fireproof aura, the forest preserver can expend three uses of her lay on hands ability as an immediate action to attempt to counter the effect, as if she had readied a&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;spell (caster level = her paladin level) to counterspell. This ability functions only if the forest preserver is conscious.<br /><br />This replaces aura of resolve.<br /><br />Sacred Grove (Su): At 11th level, a forest preserver can expend two uses of her smite evil ability to consecrate a 20-foot-radius area that must contain a living tree. This fills the area with dense undergrowth, though it does not impede her allies&rsquo; movement. In addition, animals, fey, and plants allied with the forest preserver gain a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and animals, fey, and plants called or summoned within this area gain 1 hit point per Hit Die as long as the calling or summoning effect lasts or until the sacred grove effect ends (whichever comes first). If the area contains a shrine or hallowed area dedicated to a good-aligned deity (or at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, a place of natural magical power, such as a natural portal to the First World), these bonuses are doubled.<br /><br />When she uses this ability in her favored terrain, she can also imbue plants in the area with limited animation, allowing them to obscure vision and impede movement and attacks as if the area were affected by&nbsp;solid fog.

Despite setbacks and impossible odds, they shine like candles even in the darkest times. Somewhere in their minds, they realize that they can&rsquo;t win in the end, but this only strengthens their resolve to fight for what is right, rather than giving in to hopelessness.<br /><br />Torment: A tortured crusader&rsquo;s great suffering in the face of inevitable horror strengthens her faith and resolve, even as it makes her introverted and far less personable than most paladins. A tortured crusader uses Wisdom instead of Charisma as her key spellcasting ability score (to determine her spell DCs, bonus spells per day, bonus on concentration checks, and so on), and to determine the effects of lay on hands.<br /><br />This ability alters the paladin&rsquo;s spellcasting, smite evil, and lay on hands.<br /><br />Self-Sufficient: A tortured crusader adds Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (planes), Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Use Magic Device to her list of class skills, instead of Diplomacy and Handle Animal. She gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of gaining a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + her Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />This ability alters the paladin&rsquo;s class skills and skill ranks per level.<br /><br />All is Darkness: Everything around a tortured crusader is so bleak that detecting evil only reminds her that the odds are always against her. A tortured crusader doesn&rsquo;t gain the detect evil or divine grace class features. At 1st level, a tortured crusader gains the smite evil ability, but she doesn&rsquo;t add her Charisma bonus to attack rolls or a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma bonus to her AC against the target of her smite. At 2nd level, she adds a +4 bonus to attack rolls and a +4 deflection bonus to AC against the target of her smite.<br /><br />This ability replaces detect evil and divine grace and alters smite evil.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark: Faced with endless foes, a tortured crusader can&rsquo;t ask others to confront the same horrors she does. She can&rsquo;t use her lay on hands ability to heal others or to channel energy, though starting at 4th level, she can convert two uses of lay on hands into an additional use of smite evil. Her aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness affect only her, not her allies. When she selects a divine bond, it must be with a weapon, not a mount.<br /><br />This ability alters lay on hands, channel energy, divine bond, aura of courage, aura of resolve, aura of faith, and aura of righteousness.<br /><br />Second Chance (Su): At 2nd level, once per day, a tortured crusader can spend two uses of lay on hands and choose an unambiguous trigger such as &ldquo;when I am paralyzed&rdquo; or &ldquo;when I am about to fall unconscious from hit point damage,&rdquo; as well as a mercy she knows starting at 3rd level. When the named trigger occurs, the tortured crusader gains the benefits of a lay on hands with the chosen mercy without spending an action. This healing can prevent her from falling unconscious or dying. If the effect doesn&rsquo;t trigger, it expires the next time the tortured crusader recovers uses of lay on hands.<br /><br />This ability alters lay on hands and mercy.<br /><br />Last Stand (Su): At 11th level, a tortured crusader can spend an additional use of smite evil when declaring a smite to make it a last stand. The duration of last stand&rsquo;s benefits is only 1 minute (rather than 24 hours).

She can sense her target&rsquo;s presence and location, which lets her pinpoint her target&rsquo;s location when within 10 feet; if the target has concealment, she can roll twice and use the better result on rolls to determine whether she misses due to the concealment.

{"name":"Paladin (Ghost Hunter)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Occult Adventures pg. 123</a><br />Ghost hunters devote their lives to eliminating malevolent spirits and putting them to rest.<br /><br />Ghostly Smite (Su): A ghost hunter&rsquo;s smite evil ability does not automatically bypass DR (other than DR/good). However, she treats her weapon as a&nbsp;ghost touch&nbsp;weapon against the target of her smite. She does not deal extra damage on the first attack against evil outsiders and evil dragons, but she deals 3 points of damage per paladin level she possesses to undead creatures on the first attack (instead of 2 points). This ability alters smite evil.<br /><br />Exorcise Possession (Su): At 6th level, a ghost hunter can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature. She must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and expend a use of her lay on hands ability. The target can immediately attempt a Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the effect immediately ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw. This ability replaces the 6th-level mercy.<br /><br />Speak to the Restless (Sp): At 9th level, a ghost hunter can commune with the spirits of the restless dead once per day. By holding a seance for 10 minutes, she can ask questions of a destroyed undead or a neutralized or destroyed haunt. To use this ability on a corporeal undead, the ghost hunter must have the creature&rsquo;s head in her possession. For a haunt or incorporeal undead, this seance must be held in the haunt&rsquo;s location or where the incorporeal undead was destroyed. Treat this ability as&nbsp;speak with hauntACG&nbsp;or as&nbsp;speak with dead&nbsp;(but affecting only undead rather than only corpses), using the ghost hunter&rsquo;s class level as the caster level. This ability replaces the 9th-level mercy.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Paladin","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/protect-royal-3.jpg","_id":"yjbaBf4W6ywXHuuo"}
