This ability replaces close weapon mastery.<br /><br />Maneuver Training (Ex): Whenever the wild child chooses a new maneuver for this ability, his animal companion also learns a trick to make use of this combat maneuver.

What she forgoes in weapon versatility and improved combat maneuvering, she makes up for in her ability to turn her defense into a weapon.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A shield champion is proficient with all simple weapons and with shields as weapons. She is also proficient with light armor, and with bucklers, light shields, and heavy shields. This replaces the brawler&rsquo;s weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Throw Shield (Ex): At 3rd level, a shield champion can throw a heavy or light shield as a normal (nonimprovised) thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet or the shield&rsquo;s range increment, whichever is greater. The thrown shield deals the same damage as a shield bash, and any damage increases from shield spikes apply to this attack. A shield champion is treated as having the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Far%20Shot\">Far Shot</a>&nbsp;feat for the purpose of determining range increment penalties for throwing a shield.<br /><br />At 7th level, a shield champion can use a thrown shield to perform a bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver as if she were making a melee shield bash attack. At 11th level, a shield champion gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shield%20Master\">Shield Master</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat.<br /><br />This ability replaces maneuver training at 3rd, 7th, and 11th levels.<br /><br />Champion Defense (Ex): At 15th level, once per day when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat from a weapon, unarmed, or natural attack, the shield champion can attempt to absorb all the damage with her shield. To use this ability, the shield champion must attempt a Fortitude saving throw, with the DC equal to the damage dealt. If it succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; otherwise, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability&mdash;if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can&rsquo;t use this ability. At 19th level, she can use this ability twice per day. This ability replaces the maneuver training gained at 15th and 19th levels.<br /><br />Returning Shield (Ex): At 5th level, a shield champion can throw a shield so it ricochets off her target (and possibly other solid objects) to return to her at the end of her turn. This ability functions whether or not the shield champion hits her opponent or moves on her turn. The shield deals no damage to targets it bounces off other than the original target of the shield champion&rsquo;s attack. Other circumstances can prevent the shield from returning to the shield champion, such as an opponent using a readied action to catch the shield, or the shield sticking to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mimic\">mimic&rsquo;s adhesive</a>. The shield champion can opt to not have a thrown shield return to her, in which case it falls to the ground as it normally would. If the shield has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Returning\">returning</a>&nbsp;weapon special ability, she can use either that or this ability.<br /><br />If a shield champion has additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, these additional attacks can be ricochets off an earlier target. The distance to each additional target adds to the total range of the shield, and range penalties apply, but there are no additional penalties for attacking in this manner. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, effects and modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as&nbsp;true strike) only apply to the first attack and not to the others. A shield champion can throw a shield as part of a brawler&rsquo;s flurry.<br /><br />At 9th level, a shield champion gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Greater%20Shield%20Focus\">Greater Shield Focus</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. She must meet all prerequisites before selecting that feat. At 12th level, a shield champion can use her unarmed strike damage when dealing damage with a shield (whether in melee or thrown) or the shield&rsquo;s damage, whichever is greater. At 17th level, by ricocheting her shield off a nearby surface before hitting your intended target, she can treat that surface as the origin square of the attack to determine whether the target is flanked and whether the target gains a cover bonus to its AC. She can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from her if she knows what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance. This ability replaces brawler&rsquo;s strike.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Brawler","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_11.jpg"}

Some stranglers are self-taught and are little more than brutish murderers, unhinged sociopaths, or opportunistic alley-bashers. Others are members of murder cults or specialized schools of assassination, trained since the cradle to kill with their bare hands.<br /><br />Class Skills: A strangler gains Stealth as a class skill.<br /><br />Strangle (Ex): At 1st level, a strangler deals +1d6 sneak attack damage whenever she succeeds at a grapple check to damage or pin an opponent. The strangler is always considered flanking her target for the purpose of using this ability. This damage increases by +1d6 at 2nd, 8th and 15th levels. This ability replaces unarmed strike and brawler&rsquo;s flurry.<br /><br />Practiced Strangler (Ex): At 2nd level, when a strangler has the grappled condition, she does not take a &ndash;4 penalty to Dexterity and does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC. At 9th level, a grappling or grappled strangler still threatens an area and is still able to make attacks of opportunity while grappling or grappled; when pinned, she is not denied her Dexterity bonus and does not take a &ndash;4 penalty to Armor Class. This ability replaces AC bonus.<br /><br />Sleeper Hold (Ex): At 4th level, a strangler can instantly render a pinned opponent unconscious. This works like the knockout ability, but requires a successful grapple combat maneuver check against the pinned opponent and does not have to damage the opponent. Creatures that do not need to breathe, are immune to critical hits, or are immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, a strangler can use this ability twice per day. At 16th level, she can use it three times per day. This alters knockout.<br /><br />Neckbreaker (Ex): At 16th level, a strangler can attempt to instantly kill a pinned opponent as a standard action. This works like the sleeper hold ability, but imposes a &ndash;5 penalty on her grapple combat maneuver check. If the opponent succeeds at its Fortitude save, the strangler deals damage as if she had attempted the grapple check to damage her opponent; if the opponent fails its Fortitude save, it dies. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability. At 20th level, the strangler can attempt this as a move action instead of a standard can.

The wrapped hand is known as the strong side. The other hand is kept free to deflect blows, and is known as the shield. The Zenj people of the Mwangi Expanse, who gather for large boxing tournaments, developed this style for their competitions. Many guests and visitors have witnessed these tournaments over the years, and as a result, the style has spread throughout Golarion.<br /><br />Shield-Hand (Ex): A strong-side boxer can use her off hand as if it were a buckler, gaining a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC as long as she does not use her off hand to make attacks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. While using her off hand in this manner, the strong-side boxer treats that hand as a buckler for the purposes of other feats and abilities (though she is also considered to have a free hand).<br /><br />This replaces the brawler&rsquo;s AC bonus.<br /><br />Strong-Side Fist (Ex): A strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her hands in rope or cord. The strong-side boxer can carry items or wield weapons in a wrapped hand, but she takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Dexteritybased skill checks that requires the use of that hand (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks). Unwrapping a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At 3rd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes, which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied on a critical hit. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with bleed damage from other sources.<br /><br />This replaces maneuver training.<br /><br />Lead Leg (Ex): At 5th level, a strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her legs in a chain, and can thereafter use the chain-wrapped leg both defensively and offensively. While her leg is wrapped, she is considered to be wearing a chain shirt, gaining all the appropriate bonuses and penalties. The chain can be enchanted as armor and is treated as masterwork. Once per round while wearing the chain, she can apply a +4 circumstance bonus to a trip attempt as an immediate action.<br /><br />This replaces close weapon mastery.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Brawler","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_11.jpg"}

Those who follow the straight path adhere to the traditions and techniques perfected by others who have traveled before them, while those who seek the twisted path abandon tradition and follow their own unique routes to self-perfection. Both paths can lead to the same place, but those who follow the twisted path must take care to not lose their way.<br /><br />Winding path renegades epitomize those who have chosen the twisted path. These brawlers initially studied at the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray, but while they grasped the mechanical aspects of the forms, they lacked the mental discipline required by the masters of the school. Thus, they have withdrawn from their monasteries&mdash;some peacefully, some not&mdash;to find their own paths.<br /><br />School Focus (Ex): At 2nd level, a winding path renegade continues the training she left behind, gaining the benefits of the mystery taught at her old monastery. As the winding path renegade progresses in her self-guided training, she gains a deeper understanding of her chosen monastery&rsquo;s mystery, which grants her new powers.<br /><br />Mystery of Unblinking Flame (Su): At 2nd level, the winding path renegade increases her speed by 10 feet (this is treated as an enhancement bonus). If she uses her monk moves class ability to gain fast movement, the abilities stack with each other. At 8th level, if the winding path renegade begins her turn with the grappled condition, she can deal 2d6 points of fire damage to all other creatures in the grapple as a free action. At 14th level, the winding path renegade becomes as difficult to contain as a flame. Once per day as a full-round action, she can transform into liquid flame, instantly escaping all bonds as if under the effect of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement\">freedom of movement</a>&nbsp;and moving up to her speed. When moving as part of this ability, she can move through creatures&rsquo; squares freely and doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. She deals 10d6 points of fire damage to any creature whose square she enters during this movement. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half her brawler level + her Dexterity bonus) halves this damage.<br /><br />Mystery of Unfolding Wind (Su): At 2nd level, the winding path renegade adds 10 to the range increments of ranged weapons she wields and gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Deflect%20Arrows\">Deflect Arrows</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. At 8th level, she can harness the power of the wind to make enormous leaps. As a move action, she can leap without attempting an Acrobatics check, jumping any distance up to her speed (upward movement counts as double, as when flying). She can leap in this way a number of times per day equal to her class level. At 14th level, when using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Deflect%20Arrows\">Deflect Arrows</a>&nbsp;feat, the winding path renegade can send one projectile back at her attacker, using the same attack roll and damage roll the attacker rolled against her. Even if the deflected attack had more than one projectile (as with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Manyshot\">Manyshot</a>), the winding path renegade sends only one projectile back at the attacker. The others are deflected as normal.<br /><br />Mystery of Untwisting Iron (Su): At 2nd level, metal weapons and armor in the winding path renegade&rsquo;s possession are treated as masterwork unless they have the broken condition. At 8th level, the winding path renegade gains a bonus equal to half her level on Craft checks involving metal, and she gains the benefits of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Master%20Craftsman\">Master Craftsman</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Craft%20Arms%20and%20Armor\">Craft Arms and Armor</a>&nbsp;feats when crafting items made of metal. At 14th level, any weapon the winding path renegade wields is treated as adamantine.<br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 2nd, 8th, and 14th levels.<br /><br />Monk Moves (Ex): At 4th level, a winding path renegade can use her martial flexibility ability to gain the benefits of certain monk abilities as well as combat feats. Each ability counts as one combat feat for this purpose, and the winding path renegade is treated as a monk of a level equal to her brawler level for the purpose of determining the effects of these abilities. The winding path renegade gains access to these abilities at the levels listed on the Monk Moves table above. She does not gain a ki pool, and she can&rsquo;t use powers that require ki. The winding path renegade must be wearing light or no armor to benefit from this ability.

Their martial traditions were centered on the use of farming tools and on other improvised weapons.<br /><br />Humble Beginnings (Ex): A hinyasi gains her choice of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Catch%20Off-Guard\">Catch Off-Guard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Throw%20Anything\">Throw Anything</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. She is not proficient with shields.<br /><br />This alters the brawler&rsquo;s armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Improvisation Training (Ex): A hinyasi is skilled at fighting with improvised weapons. She deals damage equal to her unarmed strike damage while fighting with an improvised weapon. A hinyasi treats improvised weapons as weapons from the close fighter weapon group.<br /><br />This replaces the bonus combat feat gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Improvised Maneuver (Ex): At 4th level, a hinyasi learns to confound and befuddle her opponents with improvised weapons. She chooses one of the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, drag, disarm, sunder, reposition, or trip. When she hits an opponent with an improvised weapon, the hinyasi can perform her chosen combat maneuver against the same target as a free action. She takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the combat maneuver check, and she can&rsquo;t attempt an improvised maneuver check more than once per round. This combat maneuver still provokes attacks of opportunity unless the hinyasi has a feat or ability that allows her to perform it without provoking attacks of opportunity.<br /><br />At 10th level, she chooses a second combat maneuver that she can use with this ability, though she can still perform only one improvised maneuver per round. At 16th level, she chooses a third, though she can still perform only one improvised maneuver per round.<br /><br />This replaces knockout.<br /><br />Improvisation Mastery (Ex): At 5th level, a hinyasi picks one type of improvised weapon (light, onehanded, or two-handed) and gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with that type of weapon.<br /><br />This replaces close weapon mastery.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Brawler","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_11.jpg"}

Sargava&rsquo;s alliance with the Shackles has led to a proliferation of the art there, and battle dancers are often found among Mwangi-descended pirates.<br /><br />Class Skills: A battle dancer gains Perform (all) as a class skill instead of Knowledge (dungeoneering).<br /><br />This alters the brawler&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Armor Proficiency: A battle dancer isn&rsquo;t proficient with shields.<br /><br />This alters the brawler&rsquo;s armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Dancer&rsquo;s Cunning (Ex): A battle dancer can treat her Charisma score as her Intelligence score for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats. In addition, she can attempt a Perform (dance) check instead of a Bluff check to feint in combat, and her unarmed strikes are considered to have the performance weapon special quality.<br /><br />This replaces brawler&rsquo;s cunning.<br /><br />Rolling Flurry (Ex): When a battle dancer uses her brawler&rsquo;s flurry, she must move 5 feet before each melee attack or combat maneuver. If she is unable to move 5 feet, she can&rsquo;t attempt any further attacks or combat maneuvers. She can&rsquo;t exceed her maximum speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity if the brawler would be able to take a 5-foot step normally; if she would be unable to (for instance, if she were in difficult terrain), the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless she succeeds at the appropriate Acrobatics checks. While using this ability, she can still take her normal 5-foot step before or after making her attacks.<br /><br />This alters brawler&rsquo;s flurry.<br /><br />Dancing Dodge (Ex): At 4th level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against a battle dancer, the battle dancer can expend one use of an attack of opportunity as an immediate action to move 5 feet, granting the battle dancer a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. The attack is still resolved normally, even if the battle dancer&rsquo;s movement takes her out of the triggering attack&rsquo;s reach. This movement is not a 5-foot step and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one that triggered this ability, though the battle dancer can attempt an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking the attacks. A battle dancer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her level. She can use this ability only while wearing light armor or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.<br /><br />This replaces AC bonus.<br /><br />Sparring Partners (Ex): At 4th level, once per day when a battle dancer gains a flanking bonus on an attack while using her rolling flurry ability, the ally providing the flank gains a flanking bonus on its next attack against that opponent, even if the battle dancer moves out of a flanking position. If either the opponent or the ally moves more than 5 feet before the ally&rsquo;s attack, the flanking bonus is lost. This ability works only if the ally is on the opposite side of an opponent during the battle dancer&rsquo;s attack, not if a flanking bonus is gained in some other way, such as through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Gang%20Up\">Gang Up</a>.

Many develop combat skills that use their prostheses so they always have a weapon at hand. Over time, these brawlers customize their mechanical limbs, adding additional weaponry and other mechanisms.<br /><br />Class Skills: A constructed pugilist gains Craft (weapons) as a class skill.<br /><br />This alters the brawler&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Constructed Limb (Ex): A constructed pugilist begins play with a special prosthetic limb built for fighting and typically made of iron, steel, stone, or wood, with the corresponding hardness and hit points (<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Smashing%20an%20Object&amp;Category=Breaking%20and%20Entering\">see Table 7-13</a>). She treats attacks with this limb as unarmed strikes that gain all the benefits of the brawler&rsquo;s unarmed strike class feature. She treats the limb as a light weapon and is proficient with it. Removing or reattaching the constructed limb takes 10 minutes.<br /><br />The constructed pugilist can improve her constructed limb as if it were a normal melee weapon. For the purpose of rebuilding the limb as a masterwork weapon, rebuilding the limb out of a special material, or adding certain magical special abilities to it, the limb counts as a one-handed melee weapon that costs 60 gp and weighs 6 pounds&mdash;though it is specially fitted to the constructed pugilist and can&rsquo;t be resold or used by anyone else. A constructed limb can benefit from either its own enhancement bonus and special abilities or those granted by an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Amulet%20of%20Mighty%20Fists\">amulet of mighty fists</a>, but if it would benefit from both simultaneously, it benefits only from the source with the higher effective enhancement bonus (the limb benefits from its own abilities in the case of a tie).<br /><br />Limb Modification: A constructed pugilist chooses one of the following limb modifications at 1st level and another at 6th, 10th, 12th, and 20th levels. These modifications do not require the constructed pugilist to rebuild her constructed limb.<br /><br />This replaces martial flexibility.<br /><br />Flex Limb: The limb is divided into jointed segments held in place with rigid rods. As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can release the rods and turn her limb into a whiplike appendage. In this mode, the prosthesis can be used to make trip attempts, and it grants a +2 bonus on disarm attempts made using it. The constructed pugilist doesn&rsquo;t run the risk of dropping her limb if she fails. Returning the limb to its rigid form takes a standard action. As a standard action, a constructed pugilist with both flex limb and limb extender can activate or deactivate one of those limb modifications or both simultaneously; when the constructed pugilist has both flex limb and limb extender activated, she gains the benefits of reach with the flex limb abilities.<br /><br />Grapnel Arm: The constructed pugilist can fire a grappling hook built into her prosthesis. The grappling hook is attached to a 40-foot-long fine chain affixed to the limb. The constructed pugilist can attack with the grappling hook as a standard action, making a ranged touch attack against the target. The grappling hook can&rsquo;t be used as part of a full attack. On a successful hit, the grappling hook deals no damage, but it functions as though it had the grapple weapon special feature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment&nbsp;22), except it requires only a hit (not a critical hit) and the grapple ends if the constructed pugilist moves more than 40 feet away from the grappled creature. The constructed limb can&rsquo;t be used to make melee attacks until the grappling hook has been reloaded (a standard action).<br /><br />Limb Extender: As a standard action, the constructed pugilist can activate an extender, giving her limb the reach weapon special feature. Returning the limb to its normal length is a standard action.<br /><br />Shielding Limb: The constructed pugilist learns to block blows with her mechanical limb. She gains a +2 shield bonus to AC, though she loses this bonus anytime she loses her Dexterity bonus to AC.<br /><br />Tight Grip: Special tensors allow the constructed pugilist to lock her grip in place. When using her constructed limb, the constructed pugilist gains a +1 bonus on Climb checks and combat maneuver checks to disarm and grapple, as well as to her CMD against attempts to disarm items held in the limb. This modification can be chosen only if the limb includes a hand or other gripping appendage.<br /><br />Vicious Blades: Razor-sharp blades on the surface of the limb cause it to deal bludgeoning and slashing damage and increase its critical threat range to 19&ndash;20. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious spikes limb modification can&rsquo;t select this modification.<br /><br />Vicious Spikes: Long spikes protrude from the limb, causing it to deal bludgeoning and piercing damage and increasing its critical multiplier to &times;3. A constructed pugilist who has the vicious blades limb modification can&rsquo;t select this modification.<br /><br />Bonus Item Creation Feats: At 2nd level, a constructed pugilist adds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Craft%20Magic%20Arms%20and%20Armor\">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Master%20Craftsman\">Master Craftsman (Craft [weapons])</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Skill%20Focus\">Skill Focus (Craft [weapons])</a>&nbsp;to the list of bonus feats she can choose (instead of just combat feats).<br /><br />This alters bonus combat feats.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Brawler","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_11.jpg"}

All allies within 30 feet are no longer flat-footed, even if they are surprised. Using this ability is a move action. At 6th level, the exemplar can use it as a swift action instead. At 10th level, she can use it as a free action. At 12th level, she can use it as an immediate action.
