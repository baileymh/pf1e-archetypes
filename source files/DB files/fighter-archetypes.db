Unlike their sorcerous brethren, dragonheir scions manifest their heritage in ways more suited to strength of arms and skill with steel than arcane energies. Those who follow this path are often the children of mighty dragon-blooded sorcerers and others who drew energy from their dragon blood, though they themselves might not exhibit spellcasting ability. <br /><br />Class Skills : The dragonheir scion adds Knowledge (arcana) and Use Magic Device to her list of class skills, instead of Handle Animal or Ride. <br /><br />This alters the fighter&rsquo;s class skills. <br /><br />Draconic Bloodline (Su): Each dragonheir scion can draw her lineage back to the influence of a great draconic progenitor. At 1st level, a dragonheir scion must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. A number of dragonheir scion&rsquo;s abilities deal damage and grant resistances based on her dragon type, as noted below. If a dragonheir scion takes a level in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be of the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the dragonheir scion can change her former bloodline to make them conform.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Chromatic Dragon Type</td>\n<td>Energy Type</td>\n<td>Metallic Dragon Type</td>\n<td>Energy Type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n<td>Brass</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>Electricity</td>\n<td>Bronze</td>\n<td>Electricity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Red</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n<td>Gold</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>White</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n<td>Silver</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br /><br />Eldritch Strikes (Su): At 1st level, a dragonheir scion gains Arcane Strike as a bonus feat. She does not need to meet its prerequisites. <br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level. <br /><br />Fearful Might (Ex): At 1st level, a dragonheir scion gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize a foe. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level and by an additional 1 every 4 fighter levels thereafter to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. <br /><br />This ability replaces bravery. <br /><br />Draconic Defense (Su) : At 3rd level, a dragonheir scion gains a +1 natural armor bonus and energy resistance 5 against her energy type. At 7th level, this increases to a +2 natural armor bonus and energy resistance 10; at 13th level, it increases to a +3 natural armor bonus and energy resistance 20. <br /><br />This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, and 3. <br /><br />Draconic Strike (Su): At 3rd level, whenever the dragonheir scion damages a target with an attack augmented by Arcane Strike, the attack deals an additional 1d4 points of damage of the dragonheir scion&rsquo;s energy type. <br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 3rd level. <br /><br />Draconic Presense (Su): At 5th level, the dragonheir scion receives Dazzling Display as a bonus feat. She does not need a weapon in hand to use this ability, and can use it as a standard action. <br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 5th level. <br /><br />Wings (Su): At 15th level, a dragonheir scion can grow leathery dragon wings from her back as a standard action, granting her a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. She can dismiss the wings as a free action. <br /><br />This ability replaces armor training 4 and armor mastery. <br /><br />Might of Wyrms (Su): At 20th level, a dragonheir scion&rsquo;s draconic heritage becomes manifest. She gains immunity to paralysis, sleep, and damage of her energy type, as well as blindsense with a range of 60 feet. <br /><br />This ability replaces weapon mastery.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Fighter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_37.jpg","_id":"1ALOGkGlG7SQoA5g"}

They have spent long years mastering the Aldori dueling sword, pitting themselves against other dueling swords and all manner of weaponry besides. Their speed and reflexes weave a net of impenetrable steel around them, from which they strike and harry their unfortunate opponents. The most common form of Aldori dueling (and arguably the easiest of the techniques to master) focuses on avoiding damage and disarming foes; these swordlords prefer to wear light or no armor, trusting their skill for protection. This archetype focuses on such techniques&mdash;characters seeking a more offensive method of focusing training on the Aldori dueling sword should consider the Aldori swordlord prestige class on page 20. However, this archetype also synergizes well with the powers and skills the prestige class offers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following benefits apply only when an Aldori defender is wielding an Aldori dueling sword (see page 24) and carrying nothing in his other hand. An Aldori defender fights with his sword wielded with both hands only in moments of desperation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Suggested Feats: Although this archetype replaces some of the bonus feats that a fighter would normally have access to, Aldori defenders still have several opportunities to gain feats. The following feats are the most thematically appropriate for an Aldori defender, but the archetype does not require any of them: Aldori Dueling Mastery (see page 24), Combat Expertise, Dazzling Display, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword), Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Initiative, Lunge, Quick Draw, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword), Weapon Specialization (Aldori dueling sword).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Defensive Parry (Ex): At 3rd level, when an Aldori defender makes a full attack with an Aldori dueling sword, he gains a +1 shield bonus to his AC against melee attacks until the beginning of his next turn. This bonus increases to +2 at 7th level, +3 at 11th level, and +4 at 15th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This ability replaces armor training.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disarming Strike (Ex): At 6th level, when an Aldori defender successfully disarms an opponent using an Aldori dueling sword, he also deals normal damage to the target, but without the normal Strength bonus to damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This ability replaces the bonus feat the fighter would normally gain at 6th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Steel Net (Ex): At 8th level, an Aldori defender can create a blazing wall of steel to defend himself.

This alters the fighter&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Improved Item Mastery (Su): At 3rd level, once per day, a relic master can use a item mastery feat she knows with a magic item that doesn&rsquo;t have an appropriate spell in its construction requirements. The magic item must meet all other requirements of the item mastery feat. Alternatively, if she is using a magic item with an appropriate spell in its construction requirements, she can use an item mastery feat without it counting against the feat&rsquo;s total uses per day. She can use this ability one additional time per day at 7th, 11th, and 15th levels. This ability replaces armor training.<br /><br />Relic Channeler (Su): At 5th level, a relic master can increase the potency of a magic item she wields by investing it with a bit of her vitality as a swift action. If the item is armor, a shield, or a weapon, its enhancement bonus increases by 1 to a maximum of +5. If the magic item creates a spell or has a save DC, its effective caster level increases by 1. A relic master can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to 1 + her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 minute). This duration doesn&rsquo;t need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. This ability replaces weapon training.<br /><br />Improvised Item Mastery (Su): At 19th level as a full-round action, the relic master can select one item mastery feat whose prerequisites she meets but that she doesn&rsquo;t already have. She gains access to this feat, though she can&rsquo;t use it as a prerequisite for other feats or options. If she selects a different item mastery feat, she loses access to her previous use of improvised item mastery and any magic effect created with it ends immediately. Any daily uses of a selected improvised item mastery feat count against all improvised mastery feats selected in the same day.

At the end of each academic year, the students all gather together and duel one another with light blades. Each student duels one opponent after another until he is marked on the cheek by an adversary&rsquo;s blade. These &ldquo;Lepidstadt scars&rdquo; are recognized throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond as marks of their prowess. The Lepidstadt Style is one of fluid motion and precise thrusts.<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An Ustalavic duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all light and medium armor and shields (except tower shields). This replaces the fighter&rsquo;s normal weapon and armor proficiencies.<br /><br />Duelist Stance (Ex): At 1st level, an Ustalavic duelist gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC as long as he is wearing no armor or light armor, wields a melee weapon in one hand, and his other hand is empty. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels the duelist possesses to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. This ability replaces the fighter&rsquo;s 1st-level bonus feat.<br /><br />Duelist Training (Ex): At 5th level, an Ustalavic duelist must select the light blades group for the weapon training class feature. The Ustalavic duelist&rsquo;s weapon training bonus with light blades increases by 1 on attack and damage rolls for every 4 levels he possesses beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 on attack and damage rolls at 17th level). If he is using his duelist stance, this damage bonus increases by 2. The Ustalavic duelist does not gain weapon training in any other groups as he increases in level. This ability replaces weapon training 1.<br /><br />Lepidstadt Thrust (Ex): At 9th level, when using Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike, an Ustalavic duelist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls (this bonus to damage is not multiplied on a critical hit). If the duelist confirms a critical hit while using one of these feats, he automatically deals maximum damage. This ability replaces weapon training 2.<br /><br />Science of the Blade (Ex): At 13th level, an Ustalavic duelist is able to apply his specialized knowledge of anatomy and physiology to his bladework. The duelist can make dirty trick (Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide 320), disarm, and trip combat maneuvers using any one-handed piercing or slashing weapon. This ability replaces weapon training 3.<br /><br />Surgical Strike (Ex): At 17th level, when an Ustalavic duelist confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing or slashing weapon, he deals ability damage in addition to the normal bonus damage from the critical hit. The duelist chooses which ability is damaged, and deals an amount of damage equal to the critical multiplier of the wielded weapon.

The weapon master must select a single type of weapon (such as longsword or shortbow).

This bonus also applies on saves against any effect that targets his chosen weapon (for example, grease, heat metal, shatter, warp wood). The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.<br /><br />Weapon Training (Ex): At 3rd level, a weapon master gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with his chosen weapon. The bonus improves by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.<br /><br />Reliable Strike (Ex): At 5th level, a weapon master may reroll an attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, miss chance check, or damage roll as an immediate action. He must accept the second roll even if it is worse. He can use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time per day for every five levels beyond 5th.

This ability replaces weapon training 2.<br /><br />Deadly Critical (Ex): At 13th level, when a weapon master confirms a critical hit with his chosen weapon, he can increase the weapon&rsquo;s damage multiplier by +1 as an immediate action. He can use this ability once per day at 13th level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels above 13th. This ability replaces weapon training 3.<br /><br />Critical Specialist (Ex): At 17th level, the save DCs of any effects caused by a critical hit with a weapon master&rsquo;s chosen weapon increase by +4. This ability replaces weapon training 4.<br /><br />Unstoppable Strike (Ex): At 19th level, a weapon master can take a standard action to make one attack with his chosen weapon as a touch attack that ignores damage reduction (or hardness, if attacking an object).

The unarmed fighter picks up a weapon only rarely, and when he does, he prefers the weapons of the monk. There are even those who mistake them for monks, but these fighters enter the fight without ki, and instead have a tough perseverance that few can rival. <br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An unarmed fighter is not proficient with medium armor, heavy armor, or shields. An unarmed fighter is proficient with all monk weapons, including exotic monk weapons. <br /><br />Unarmed Style: At 1st level, a unarmed fighter gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat and any single style feat (see Chapter 3) as a bonus feat. The unarmed fighter need not meet all the prerequisites of the style feat he chooses, but style feats that grant additional uses of the Elemental Fist feat cannot be taken until the unarmed fighter has that feat. This ability replaces the bonus feat at 1st level.<br /><br />Harsh Training (Ex): At 2nd level, an unarmed fighter gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause the exhausted, fatigued, or staggered conditions or temporary penalties to ability scores. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.<br /><br />Tough Guy (Ex): At 3rd level, an unarmed fighter gains DR/&mdash; equal to half his fighter level against nonlethal damage or damage taken while he is grappled. This ability replaces armor training 1. <br /><br />Weapon Training (Ex): At 5th level, an unarmed fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with weapons in the monk and natural weapon groups, improving by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level). This ability replaces weapon training 1, 2, 3, and 4. <br /><br />Clever Wrestler (Ex): At 7th level, an unarmed fighter takes no penalties to Dexterity or on attack rolls while grappled, and retains his Dexterity bonus to AC while pinning an opponent. The unarmed fighter can make attacks of opportunity even when grappled and even against creatures attempting to grapple him if the opponent has the Improved Grapple feat or the grab ability. This ability replaces armor training 2.<br /><br />Trick Throw (Ex): At 8th level, when an unarmed fighter successfully trips an opponent with an unarmed attack, he can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against that creature (before the opponent becomes prone) as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces the 8th-level bonus feat. <br /><br />Takedown (Ex): At 12th level, if an unarmed fighter succeeds on a drag maneuver, he can attempt a trip maneuver against the same target as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 15th level, he may do so after a successful grapple check. This ability replaces the 12th-level bonus feat.<br /><br />Eye Gouge (Ex): At 13th level, if an unarmed fighter confirms a critical hit with his unarmed strike or begins his turn grappled, he may attempt a dirty trick maneuver to blind his target as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A target more than one size category larger is unaffected. This ability replaces weapon training 3.<br /><br />Sucker Punch (Ex): At 17th level, when an unarmed fighter strikes a creature that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, or that he has successfully pinned with a grapple check, he can attempt a dirty trick or trip combat maneuver against that target as a swift action. This ability replaces armor training 4. <br /><br />Sheer Toughness (Ex): At 19th level, an unarmed fighter becomes immune to nonlethal damage and the exhausted, fatigued, and staggered conditions.

These fighters use their training and tactical acumen to overcome challenges that would overwhelm mere brute strength and skill at arms. <br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A tactician is not proficient with heavy armor or tower shields.<br /><br />Strategic Training (Ex): A tactician gains 4 skill points + a number of skill points equal to his Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of the normal 2 skill points + Intelligence modifier at each level. Furthermore, Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), and Sense Motive (Wis) are all class skills for the tactician. This ability replaces the bonus fighter combat feat gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: A tactician may choose Skill Focus or any teamwork feat, in addition to combat feats, as bonus feats. <br /><br />Tactical Awareness (Ex): At 2nd level, a tactician gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.<br /><br />Tactician (Ex): At 5th level, a tactician gains this ability as the cavalier class feature. He may use this ability once per day at 5th level, plus one additional time for every five levels after 5th (to a maximum of four times at 20th level). If the tactician also has cavalier levels, these levels stack for determining the number of uses per day, and he can take the better progression. This ability replaces weapon training 1.<br /><br />Cooperative Combatant (Ex): At 11th level, when a tactician uses the aid another special attack, he may affect one additional ally per point of Intelligence bonus. For each ally that a tactician aids, he can pick whether to grant that ally the +2 bonus on its next attack against the opponent or the +2 bonus to AC against the opponent&rsquo;s next attack on that ally, and can grant different allies different bonuses. This ability replaces armor training 3.<br /><br />Battle Insight (Ex): At 15th level, as a swift action, a tactician can grant his Intelligence modifier as an insight bonus on the attack rolls made by a single ally within line of sight that can both see and hear the tactician. That ally gains the bonus until the end of the tactician&rsquo;s next turn. The tactician can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier.

Instead of encasing himself in metal armor like the soldiers fighting and dying for the socalled civilized lands do, he prefers to wear something he or his ancestors have killed. These relics and trophies help the tribal fighter attain a battle focus that allows him to perform incredible feats of violence with the simplest of weapons.<br /><br />Forbidden Armor: A tribal fighter favors traditional armor and shields, avoiding other types out of spiritual devotion, superstitious suspicion, or respect for tradition. He can attain his battle focus (see page 51) only while using armaments of the appropriate types. Like a druid, a tribal fighter is prohibited from wearing metal armor and using metal shields. A tribal fighter who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield loses the benefits of the battle focus and tribal weapon training abilities while doing so and for 24 hours after removing the prohibited armor or shield.<br /><br />Battle Focus (Ex): A tribal fighter learns to fight with his bare hands and wield traditional tribal weapons so effortlessly that they are almost extensions of his arms.

Additionally, if the tribal fighter has combat feats that apply to a specific weapon type (such as Improved Critical or Weapon Focus) and he has selected a weapon that belongs to the tribal weapon group, he can apply the benefits of that feat to all weapons that belong to the tribal weapon group that would legally apply (for instance, a feat that applies only to throwing weapons wouldn&rsquo;t apply to greatclubs).

To make up for the broken routine of adventuring life and the frequent compromises necessary in the presence of such allies, such roaming armigers are expected to perform frequent reckonings.

If the armiger later gains levels in a Hellknight prestige class, she must select that same order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Studious Squire: An armiger gains 2 additional skill ranks at each level. These ranks must be put into Intimidate and Knowledge (planes). In addition, the armiger treats Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (planes) as class skills.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This alters the fighter&rsquo;s class skills and skill points per level, and replaces the fighter&rsquo;s bonus feats gained at 1st and 10th levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ardent (Su): Armigers are difficult to sway from their beliefs. At 2nd level, an armiger gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against charm effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 fighter levels beyond 2nd. Once per day, if an armiger is forced to take an action that is diametrically opposed to her order&rsquo;s beliefs and values while under the influence of a charm or compulsion effect, she can immediately attempt a Will save against the effect&rsquo;s DC to resist acting out that order. Success does not remove the existing charm or compulsion effect, but does allow the armiger to resist betraying her beliefs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This replaces bravery.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Fighter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_37.jpg","_id":"Y6BvdlERXS56sxMN"}

Capable of relentless brutality and quick to ﬂare into open hostilities, warlords cloak their violent ways with paens to great noble houses or honored ancient traditions, bringing an air of respectability and etiquette to the butchery of brazen blades against bare skin. Warlords eschew armor as impractical to their harsh and often desert-like environment, preferring the free movement of near- nakedness. Warlords tend to specialize in the traditional weapons of Barsoom, leaving them ignorant of even simple Weapons common on other worlds. The same impulse that guides a warlord to stick to the traditional garb and gear of his culture can lead to a single-mindedness of purpose that can propel him far within his tribe or noble house. Even warlords of low status in Martian society claim a connection&mdash; no matter how ancient&mdash;with some great chieftain or emperor, seeing in the glorious past a path to a more hopeful future. Barsoom confers noble status upon its warlords through ritual combat in the case of green Martians or on merit and upon great achievement or heroics in the case of red Martians, so climbing the ladder ofstatus is an important part of a warlord&rsquo;s journey through life.<br /><br />Class Skills: The warlord gains Acrobatics and Knowledge (nobility) as class skills as replacements for Swim and Knowledge (dungeoneering).<br /><br />Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency: A warlord is proﬁcient with the halberd. radium pistol*, rapier, radium riﬂe*, longspear, longsword, shortspear, spear, Thark riﬂe*, trident, and whip.<br /><br />Warlords are not proﬁcient with armor or shields. <br /><br />This ability replaces the ﬁghter&rsquo;s standard Weapon and Armor Proﬁciency class feature.<br /><br />Evasive Dueling (Ex): At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, warlord can add a +1 dodge bonus to his Armor Class instead of taking a bonus feat.

In order to repel a much larger enemy force, some soldiers must abandon equipment and tactics designed for open-field warfare and instead rely on ambushes, hit-andrun tactics, and sabotage to whittle down their enemies&rsquo; strength and morale. Skirmishers use harsh weather and unforgiving terrain to their advantage, attacking isolated groups of enemies that cannot flee or fight back effectively. Many tribal warriors also employ small-unit tactics because it is part of their warrior culture, because they cannot field a large army, or simply because they refuse to fight on the enemy&rsquo;s terms.<br /><br />Armor Proficiency: A skirmisher is proficient with light armor and shields but not with medium armor, heavy armor, or tower shields.<br /><br />This replaces the fighter&rsquo;s armor proficiency.<br /><br />Wilderness Training (Ex): A skirmisher relies on his skills and the element of surprise rather than the heaviest shields and armor. He gains Acrobatics and Stealth as class skills. In addition, the skirmisher gains a number of skill ranks at each level equal to 4 + his Intelligence modifier, instead of 2 + his Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />This alters the fighter&rsquo;s class skills and skill ranks per level.<br /><br />Conditioning (Ex): At 2nd level, a skirmisher becomes more resistant to mental and physical threats that are commonly employed by his enemies or often encountered in the terrain in which he operates. The skirmisher must choose one of the specializations below, gaining a +1 bonus on saving throws of the appropriate type. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd.<br /><br />Alpine Training (Ex): A skirmisher operating in mountainous terrain becomes resistant to cold climates and the rigors of long treks at high altitudes. He gains a bonus on Fortitude saving throws against altitude sickness, exposure to cold weather, and other effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion.<br /><br />Counter-Interrogation Training (Ex): A skirmisher undertaking infiltration missions learns to resist interrogation and persuasion. The skirmisher gains a bonus on Will saving throws against charms and divinations.<br /><br />Jungle Training (Ex): Through repeated exposure, a skirmisher operating in jungles and wetlands builds up a tolerance against pathogens and toxins. He gains a bonus on Fortitude saving throws against disease and poison.<br /><br />Light Infantry Training (Ex): A skirmisher fighting in a light infantry unit learns to avoid fire from enemy artillery, siege weapons, and spellcasters. He gains a bonus on Reflex saving throws against attacks that deal half damage on a successful save (such as the fireball spell) but not against traps, natural hazards, or environmental effects.<br /><br />This replaces the bonus feat the fighter normally receives at 2nd level.<br /><br />Reconnaissance Training (Ex): A skirmisher operating in heavily trapped or naturally hazardous areas learns to expertly avoid them. At 2nd level, he gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws to avoid traps, natural hazards, and environmental effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 2nd.<br /><br />This replaces bravery.<br /><br />Mobility Training (Ex): At 3rd level, a skirmisher learns to be more maneuverable while wearing light or no armor. He gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor and while carrying no more than a light load. Anything that causes the skirmisher to lose his Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the skirmisher to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +4 at 15th level).<br /><br />In addition, a skirmisher gains an enhancement bonus of +5 feet to his base speed.

He gains a 20% miss chance on attacks against him. Mobile mastery functions even when the skirmisher is flat-footed, but not when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears medium or heavy armor, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.<br /><br />This replaces armor mastery.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Fighter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_37.jpg","_id":"hR437j5U9QRPdNwZ"}

Tower shield specialists defy those notions, using their massive shields with startling skill and incredible effect. They use these seemingly clumsy shields to perform deft maneuvers that confound their enemies.<br /><br />Burst Barrier (Ex): At 2nd level, a tower shield specialist can use his shield to screen himself from burst spells and effects, gaining a +1 bonus on Reflex saves against them while employing a tower shield. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). This ability replaces bravery.<br /><br />Tower Shield Training (Ex): At 3rd level, a tower shield specialist gains armor training as normal, but while he employs a tower shield, the armor penalty is reduced by 3 and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor increases by 2.

At 11th level, whenever he takes a move, double move, withdraw, or run action underwater, he can leave a current behind him in the squares along his path; this current has a speed of 10 feet in the direction of his movement (if his movement was circuitous, so is the current) and lasts until the beginning of his next turn. At 15th level, as a full round action, an aquanaut can spin ferociously underwater, creating a whirlpool around himself with a spinning force that drags all creatures within 120 feet of him 30 feet closer to him. Creatures closer than 30 feet spend the 30 feet of movement circling around the aquanaut in a single direction of his choice.

They use their bucklers both to defend themselves and to launch unexpected strikes while chopping and hewing at their foes&rsquo; unprotected bodies and heads with their falcatas. Rondeleros wear any type of armor, but favor bucklers, and are comfortable using both hands for offense and defense.<br /><br />Suggested Feats: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (falcata), Improved Shield Bash, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Power Attack, Shield Slam, Shield Master, Taldan Duelist (see World Guide: The Inner Sea), Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus (falcata), Weapon Specialization (falcata).<br /><br />Buckler Bash (Ex): At 2nd level, a rondelero can perform a shield bash with a buckler (use the same damage and critical modifier as for a light shield).

This ability replaces bravery.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blackjacket Tactics (Ex): At 4th level, two or more Druman Blackjackets can spend 1 minute discussing strategy, then choose a single teamwork feat (Advanced Players Guide 150) possessed by at least one of them. For a number of hours equal to the class level of the highest-level Blackjacket, the participants each gain the benefits of the selected feat even if they do not meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites. If a creature benefiting from this ability moves more than 30 feet away from any other participant, it loses all benefits of this ability until it is again within 30 feet. Creatures that do not have levels in this archetype can&rsquo;t benefit from this ability, and no creature can benefit from this ability more than once at any given time. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 4th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amateurs! (Ex): At 8th level, when using the Blackjacket tactics ability, a Druman Blackjacket can include one or more creatures without levels in this archetype, but doing so reduces the duration of the effect to a number of minutes equal to the class level of the highest-level Blackjacket instead of a number of hours per level. If only Blackjackets are included in the effect, all Druman Blackjackets affected gain a +1 morale bonus on skill checks and saving throws for the duration of the effect. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 8th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Superior Tactics (Ex): At 12th level, a Druman Blackjacket who uses the Blackjacket tactics ability can allow all affected Blackjackets to gain a second bonus teamwork feat possessed by at least one of the participants. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 12th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Esprit de Corps (Ex): At 16th level, a Druman Blackjacket grants all Blackjackets with whom he is sharing one or more teamwork feats through the Blackjacket tactics ability a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. Each affected Blackjacket increases this bonus by 1 if another affected Blackjacket has been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points since the beginning of his last turn.

These fighting school benefits apply when wielding a weapon and a shield simultaneously.<br /><br />Active Defense (Ex): At 3rd level, a shielded fighter gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC when wielding a shield and fighting defensively, using Combat Expertise, or using total defense. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. As a swift action, he may share this bonus with one adjacent ally, or half of the bonus (minimum +0) with all adjacent allies, until the beginning of his next turn.

A lore warden is the consummate warrior-scholar of the Pathfinder Society, outsmarting her competition even when locking blades with powerful foes. Outside of combat, a lore warden&rsquo;s extensive education also helps her document the past and survive great danger.<br /><br />Scholastic (Ex): A lore warden gains 2 additional skill ranks each level. These ranks must be spent on Intelligence-based skills. All Craft and Knowledge skills are class skills for lore wardens, as are Linguistics and Spellcraft.<br /><br />This ability replaces the fighter&rsquo;s proficiency with medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.<br /><br />Skill Over Strength (Ex): At 2nd level, a lore warden qualifies for feats and other abilities as though she had the Combat Expertise feat. At 6th level, she gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if she would not normally qualify for the feat. If she already has Combat Expertise, she instead gains any one combat feat that includes Combat Expertise as a prerequisite (and for which she otherwise qualifies). At 10th level, she can treat her base attack bonus as though it were 2 higher for the purpose of calculating the effects of Combat Expertise.<br /><br />This ability replaces bravery and the fighter bonus feat gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Swords Secret (Ex): A lore warden learns specialized techniques that help her to quickly analyze and defeat her foes. At 3rd level, a lore warden gains one swords secret, and she gains an additional swords secret for every 4 fighter levels gained after 3rd. Except where noted, a lore warden cannot select the same swords secret more than once.<br /><br />Exploit Weakness (Ex): The lore warden adds one-third her class level on attack rolls to confirm critical hits. At 11th level, whenever she confirms a critical hit, her weapon attacks ignore the first 5 points of damage reduction or hardness the target has until the end of her next turn. At 19th level, the lore warden can automatically confirm a critical hit once per round when she threatens a critical hit.<br /><br />Hair&rsquo;s Breadth (Ex): Once per day when subject to a critical hit, the lore warden can attempt an Acrobatics check to reduce the damage as an immediate action. If the result of this Acrobatics check is greater than the opponent&rsquo;s confirmation roll, she negates the critical hit; the attack still hits and deals normal damage. The lore warden must be at least 11th level to select this swords secret. At 15th level she can use this secret one additional time per day.<br /><br />Know Thy Enemy (Ex): When the lore warden succeeds at a Knowledge check to identify a creature&rsquo;s abilities and weaknesses, she can also use a standard action to grant herself a +2 insight bonus on all attack and weapon damage rolls made against that enemy. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to half her class level (minimum 2 rounds), or until the lore warden uses this ability against a different creature. At 11th level, she also gains a +2 bonus to her AC against the creature when using this ability. At 19th level, the insight bonus increases to +3.<br /><br />Maneuver Training (Ex): The lore warden gains a brawler&rsquo;s maneuver training class feature, treating her fighter level as her brawler level.<br /><br />Swift Assessment (Ex): The lore warden can now use her know thy enemy swords secret as a move action.

The steelbound fighter is sometimes the result of such a legacy: a fighter who has impressive martial resolve and technique with a specific weapon as the result of a powerful relationship a similar weapon had with one of his&nbsp;ancestors. <br /><br />Steelbound Weapon (Ex) : At 1st level, a steelbound fighter selects one type of weapon (such as shortswords, longbows, or heavy flails). He gains Weapon Focus with that specific weapon. Whenever he isn&rsquo;t wielding or carrying at least one weapon of this type (the weapon can be broken but not destroyed), a steelbound fighter takes a &ndash;2 penalty to his Wisdom score and can&rsquo;t benefit from his fighter class abilities (excluding bonus feats gained from fighter levels). Once the steelbound fighter&rsquo;s weapon awakens (see steelbound awakening below), these penalties apply whenever the fighter isn&rsquo;t carrying or wielding that particular weapon.<br /><br />This ability replaces the fighter&rsquo;s 1st-level bonus feat. <br /><br />Steelbound Awakening (Su) : At 5th level, one nonintelligent weapon carried by the steelbound fighter becomes possessed by the latent spiritual energies that cling to his soul, transforming that weapon into an intelligent weapon. The weapon must be of the type the fighter chose at 1st level as his steelbound weapon. The steelbound weapon grants its wielder Alertness as a bonus feat as long as the weapon is wielded. A steelbound fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with his steelbound weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level, +3 at 13th level, +4 at 17th level, and +5 at 20th level.<br /><br />A steelbound weapon gains Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10 when it awakens, and has the same alignment as its wielder. It communicates via empathy, and has senses that extend 30 feet. It has 5 ranks in a skill of the steelbound fighter&rsquo;s choice.<br /><br />At 9th level, the steelbound weapon&rsquo;s ability scores increase to 12 and it gains the ability to speak in its wielder&rsquo;s native tongue. The weapon gains the ability to cast a 3rd-level spell once per day (the choice of the spell is made by the steelbound fighter, but is subject to GM approval, and once chosen, it can&rsquo;t be changed), with a caster level equal to the steelbound fighter&rsquo;s level. The spell&rsquo;s save DC is based off of the item&rsquo;s Charisma.<br /><br />At 13th level, the steelbound weapon&rsquo;s ability scores increase to 14 and its senses extend to 120 feet. The weapon gains a special purpose of the steelbound fighter&rsquo;s choice (subject to GM approval).<br /><br />At 17th level, the steelbound weapon&rsquo;s ability scores increase to 16 and it gains telepathy as well as darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The weapon can now use its spelllike ability three times a day, and can select a second 3rdlevel spell that it can use once per day.<br /><br />A steelbound fighter transfers the effects of his steelbound awakening to a new weapon of the proper type automatically after carrying that weapon on his person for 24 hours, but can have only one weapon under the effects of steelbound awakening at any given time.<br /><br />This ability replaces weapon training.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Fighter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_37.jpg","_id":"ydNlfMoE6XDH1fGf"}

If his obligation dies, the high guardian must atone for 1 week before he can select another obligation.<br /><br />Right Hand (Ex): At 1st level, a high guardian can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action, as long as he ends this movement adjacent to his obligation. If he takes this step, he cannot take a 5-foot step during his next turn and his total movement is reduced by 5 feet during his next turn.<br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Defender&rsquo;s Reflexes (Ex): At 2nd level, a high guardian gains Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat, and he can use his Strength modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier to determine the number of additional attacks of opportunity he can make per round. If he already has Combat Reflexes, he instead gains Stand Still as a bonus feat.<br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Unassailable Allegiance (Ex): At 2nd level, a high guardian gains a +1 bonus on Will saves against compulsion spells and effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 fighter levels beyond 2nd.<br /><br />This ability replaces bravery.<br /><br />Royal Protector (Ex): At 4th level, a high guardian gains BodyguardAPG and In Harm&rsquo;s WayAPG as bonus feats, though he can use them only to improve his obligation&rsquo;s AC or intercept a successful attack against his obligation.<br /><br />This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 4th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Fighter","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_37.jpg","_id":"ylu8npHWTPT17CYy"}
