,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Elemental Ascetic""]]",Kineticist (Elemental Ascetic),Elemental Ascetic,<id-00026,2,AC Bonus,"<p>At 2nd level, when unarmored, not using a shield, and unencumbered, an elemental ascetic adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and his CMD. These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the elemental ascetic is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 kineticist levels the elemental ascetic possesses beyond 2nd. The elemental ascetic's kineticist levels stack with monk levels for the purpose of determining when the bonus increases. An elemental ascetic can never take the expanded defense utility wild talent. This ability replaces elemental defense.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Arakineticist""]]",Kineticist (Arakineticist),Arakineticist,<id-00022,13,Accursed Infusion,"<p>At 13th level, an arakineticist's blasts can temporarily curse and bedevil her foe. On a failed Will save, the target takes a -4 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skills checks for 1 round as if it were affected by bestow curse. A single creature can't be affected by more than one curse from this infusion at a time. This is a 6th-level substance infusion that costs 4 points of burn and can be used with negative and void blasts.</p><p>This replaces the utility wild talent gained at 13th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg

She gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against necromancy spells and death effects. This bonus increases by 1 every 4 levels beyond 4th, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level.</p><p>This replaces the utility wild talent gained at 4th level.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg

,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Ioun Kineticist""]]",Kineticist (Ioun Kineticist),Ioun Kineticist,<id-00050,7,Azlanti Blast,"<p>An ioun kineticist who selects aether as her expanded element does not gain the force composite blast. She instead gains the Azlanti composite blast, which costs 2 points of burn. An Azlanti blast is a physical blast that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Elysiokineticist""]]",Kineticist (Elysiokineticist),Elysiokineticist,<id-00046,1,Basic Elysiokinesis,"<p>An elysiokineticist can use the power of Elysium to assist others and bolster their vigor, allowing her to cast resistance, stabilize, or virtue as a spell-like ability at will as a standard action.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Ioun Kineticist""]]",Kineticist (Ioun Kineticist),Ioun Kineticist,<id-00047,1,Basic Iounkinesis,"<p>An ioun kineticist can manipulate ioun stones with ease and channel their magical fields to create simple effects. She can activate (making the stones orbit her) or stow a number of ioun stones equal to her class level in any combination as a move action, and she can activate or stow twice as many as a standard action. She can affect only ioun stones orbiting her and unattended ioun stones within 15 feet with this ability. This ability also allows her to cast prestidigitation at will as a spell-like ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Leshykineticist""]]",Kineticist (Leshykineticist),Leshykineticist,<id-00025,1,Basic Leshykinesis,"<p>A vine leshy leshykineticist can use her basic phytokinesis to move while in her alternate vine form, with a base speed of 10 feet and a climb speed of 10 feet. The vine counts as a prehensile appendage for the purpose of aiming kinetic blasts and gathering power. At the GM's discretion, this ability might apply to leshykineticists of other leshy varieties as long as their alternate forms aren't rooted to the ground (and even then, they might be able to use something like a branch to aim kinetic blasts).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Aquakinetcist""]]",Kineticist (Aquakinetcist),Aquakinetcist,<id-00046,1,Basis Aquakinesis,"<p>An aquakineticist can create mild currents, as per basic hydrokinesis. Additionally, she can adjust her buoyancy (see page 43) to whatever level she wishes as a standard action, lasting until she uses basic aquakinesis again.</p><p>This ability replaces basic hydrokinesis as her basic utility talent, and alters elemental focus.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Elemental Annihilator""]]",Kineticist (Elemental Annihilator),Elemental Annihilator,<id-00018,5,Blast Training,"<p>At 1st level, a kineticist gains an infusion wild talent from the list of options available based on her elemental focus. She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion. Some infusions change the action required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects. The burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies.</p><p>The DC for a save against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective spell level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using the kineticist's Dexterity modifier instead of her Constitution modifier. When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion's effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion. If a kineticist's form and substance infusions both alter the kinetic blast's damage, apply the substance infusion's alteration first.</p><p>At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, a kineticist can replace one of her infusions with another infusion of the same effective spell level or lower. She can't replace an infusion that she used to qualify for another of her wild talents.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Blood Kineticist""]]",Kineticist (Blood Kineticist),Blood Kineticist,<id-00018,5,Bleeding Infusion,"<p>At 5th level, a blood kineticist can infuse her blasts with a vicious power that causes internal or external bleeding. On a failed Fortitude save, the target takes 1 point of bleed damage for every die of the blast's damage. A target that fails its saving throw against the wrack form infusion does not receive a saving throw to avoid the bleed damage from bleeding infusion on the same blast. This is a 2nd-level substance infusion that costs 2 points of burn and can be used with water and blood blasts. This ability replaces the 5th-level infusion.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Blightburner""]]",Kineticist (Blightburner),Blightburner,<id-00047,2,Blightburn Aura,"<p>At 2nd level, a blightburner's body surges with a greenish, radioactive glow whenever she accepts burn. This energy sheds light like a candle. A creature that hits the blightburner with a natural attack, unarmed strike, or non-reach melee weapon attack while she's under the effect of her blightburn aura takes fire damage equal to her elemental overflow bonus (minimum 1). By accepting 2 points of burn, she can increase this damage by an amount equal to her elemental overflow bonus; she can increase the damage in this way up to four times. A blightburner can temporarily suppress the visual effects of a blightburn aura by concentrating for 1 full round, but doing so also suppresses all of this ability's other benefits. The next time she uses a wild talent, the visual effects and benefits return instantly.</p><p>At 6th level, whenever the blightburner has at least 3 points of burn, the blightburn aura expands to fill all adjacent squares. In addition to damaging creatures that hit the blightburner with melee attacks, the aura also deals damage to other creatures that end their turns within the aura.</p><p>At 11th level, whenever the kineticist has at least 5 points of burn, the blightburn aura expands to a 10-foot-radius aura, and any creature that takes damage from it must also succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the blightburner's level + her Constitution bonus) or be sickened for 1 round. This ability is a poison effect.</p><p>At 16th level, whenever a blightburner has at least 7 points of burn, any creature that takes damage from the blightburn aura and fails its Fortitude save also become fatigued.</p><p>This ability replaces the ability score boosts granted by elemental overflow and earth's elemental defense, but the blightburner can still gain elemental defenses from other elements with expanded defense.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Blightburner""]]",Kineticist (Blightburner),Blightburner,<id-00046,1,Blightburn Manipulation,"<p>A blightburner can harness radiation for nondestructive purposes. A blightburner can channel blightburn radiation as a standard action, causing herself to glow like a torch. This effect lasts until she dismisses it as a standard action. Additionally, she can generate small amounts of heat with her hands. This radiation can slowly heat unattended objects with a touch to a warm (but not painfully hot) temperature, or cook raw meat or vegetable matter at a rate of 1 pound per minute. If used on a living creature, this ability deals 1 point of nonlethal damage per minute of contact, which manifests as reddened and blistering skin.</p><p>This ability replaces the basic geokinesis wild talent gained from elemental focus.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Blood Kineticist""]]",Kineticist (Blood Kineticist),Blood Kineticist,<id-00046,7,Blood Blast,"<p>The first time a blood kineticist selects water with expanded element, she doesn't gain the cold simple blast or the ice composite blast; instead, she gains the blood composite blast, which costs 2 points of burn. A blood blast is a physical blast that deals bludgeoning damage. It is associated with the same infusions as the water blast. If the blood kineticist selects water with expanded element a second time, she gains the cold simple blast and ice composite blast as normal. This ability alters expanded element.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Blood Kineticist""]]",Kineticist (Blood Kineticist),Blood Kineticist,<id-00025,2,Blood Focus,<p>A blood kineticist must choose water as her primary element and must choose water blast as her first simple blast. All of her infusions granted by this archetype work only on targets with blood and automatically fail if the target is immune to bleed damage.</p>,systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Blood Kineticist""]]",Kineticist (Blood Kineticist),Blood Kineticist,<id-00044,20,Blood Mastery,"<p>At 20th level, a blood kineticist no longer ages and can't be magically aged. She doesn't take penalties to her ability scores for aging and removes any such penalties she already possesses. She still accrues age bonuses as normal, but she doesn't die of old age when her time would be up. Because of her utter control over her own blood, she is immune to bleed, injected poisons, injury diseases, and the sickened and nauseated conditions unless she chooses to be affected. This ability replaces omnikinesis.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Blood Kineticist""]]",Kineticist (Blood Kineticist),Blood Kineticist,<id-00005,6,Blood Tell,"<p>At 6th level, a blood kineticist's connection to blood allows her to learn much from the blood of another. This works as blood biographyAPG, except the blood kineticist suddenly knows the information, rather than having it appear on a parchment. This is a 3rd-level utility wild talent and costs 0 points of burn. She can accept 1 point of burn to reduce the casting time to a standard action instead of 1 minute. This ability replaces the 6th-level utility wild talent.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Blood Kineticist""]]",Kineticist (Blood Kineticist),Blood Kineticist,<id-00006,8,Blood Throw,"<p>At 8th level, a blood kineticist gains the foe throw infusion as a bonus infusion, and can use it with the water element on water and blood blasts, in addition to its normal associated element and blast. This ability replaces the 8th-level utility wild talent.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Elemental Annihilator""]]",Kineticist (Elemental Annihilator),Elemental Annihilator,<id-00047,2,Bonus Feat,"<p>At 2nd level, an elemental annihilator can select a bonus feat from the following list: Deadly Aim, Double Slice, Point-Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Two- Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus. Rapid Shot and Two-Weapon Fighting can be used with a kinetic blast only if the annihilator also possesses flurry of devastation (see below). She gains an additional bonus feat at 8th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels. At 8th level, she can also select Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Weapon Specialization. At 10th level, she can also select Greater Weapon Focus, Improved Critical, Improved Precise Shot, and Two-Weapon Rend. An elemental annihilator doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for these feats to select them as bonus feats. This ability replaces the 2nd-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 18th-level utility wild talents.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Psammokinetic""]]",Kineticist (Psammokinetic),Psammokinetic,<id-00019,1,Burning Winds,"<p>A psammokinetic must select air as her elemental focus. In place of the air blast and electric blast normally granted to an aerokinetic, the psammokinetic gains a sand blast or sirocco blast. Except as noted below, sand blast functions as air blast, and sirocco blast functions as electric blast (including when determining what infusion wild talents the psammokinetic can use with each blast). The psammokinetic is also treated as having the fire element type for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites for the cold adaptation, flame shield, heat adaptation, and heat wave utility wild talents. A psammokinetic cannot take the chain, magnetic infusion, or thundering infusion wild talents or the aerial adaptation or celerity utility wild talents.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Aquakinetcist""]]",Kineticist (Aquakinetcist),Aquakinetcist,<id-00047,2,Call of the Deep,"<p>At 2nd level, an aquakineticist gains waterdancer as a bonus utility wild talent. At 6th level, she gains watersense as a bonus utility wild talent, and she can choose to ignore the effects of currents with speeds up to 60 feet while her waterdancer ability is active.</p><p>This replaces the 2nd and 6th level utility wild talents.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Arakineticist""]]",Kineticist (Arakineticist),Arakineticist,<id-00005,6,Curse Spinner,"<p>An arakineticist learns to wield her living curse like a needle to weave and unravel curses. At 6th level, an arakineticist can accept 1 point of burn to cast remove curse as a spell-like ability. At 8th level, she can accept 1 point of burn to curse a target as bestow curse as spell-like ability.

She gains all Knowledge skills as class skills.</p><p>A dark elementalist uses her Intelligence modifier instead of her Constitution modifier to determine her damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the durations of wild talents with Constitution-based durations, her bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and any other Constitution-based effects of all her wild talents.</p><p>This alters the kineticist's class skills and base saving throws and the key ability score of wild talents.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Elemental Annihilator""]]",Kineticist (Elemental Annihilator),Elemental Annihilator,<id-00025,1,Devastating Infusion,"<p>At 1st level, an elemental annihilator can either shoot her kinetic blast at a target within 30 feet or make a single melee attack as if she were using kinetic blade as an attack action. For this attack, the elemental annihilator's base attack bonus from her kineticist levels is equal to her full kineticist level. A devastating infusion always deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + the elemental annihilator's Constitution modifier, regardless of the annihilator's class level or use of composite blasts. When making a melee attack with devastating infusion, the elemental annihilator doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, and if she uses two hands, the attack's damage is equal to 1d8 + 1-1/2 times her Constitution modifier. This is a 1st-level form infusion that costs 0 points of burn and can be used with any physical blast (but not energy blasts). Unlike with kinetic blade, the elemental annihilator can use Vital Strike with devastating infusion. The damage bonus from elemental overf low doesn't apply to devastating infusion's damage rolls.

,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Elemental Purist""]]",Kineticist (Elemental Purist),Elemental Purist,<id-00044,20,Elemental Apocalypse,"<p>At 20th level, an elemental purist learns the apocalypse universal form infusion (Level 9; Burn 5; Associated Blasts any; Saving Throw Reflex half ) that she can use once per day. The apocalypse form infusion functions as the explosion form infusion, except the elemental purist can center the spread anywhere she can see within 1 mile, and she can choose to set the radius anywhere between 5 feet and 360 feet.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Kinetic Knight""]]",Kineticist (Kinetic Knight),Kinetic Knight,<id-00046,1,Elemental Bastion,"<p>At 2nd level, the kinetic knight becomes proficient with medium and heavy armor and shields (except tower shields). In addition, the kinetic knight can accept 1 point of burn to attune herself to a specific light or heavy shield until the next time her burn is removed. Wielding an attuned shield doesn't prevent the kinetic knight from gathering power. A kinetic knight gains the elemental defense ability at 4th level, rather than 2nd, and its benefits apply only while she is wearing heavy armor and wielding an attuned shield. If the kinetic knight selects the expanded defense talent, its benefits also apply only under these conditions. If she has the shroud of water defense wild talent, whenever its bonus would be increased by accepting burn, she instead increases the enhancement bonus of her armor or attuned shield by an equal amount (to a maximum of +5).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Kinetic Knight""]]",Kineticist (Kinetic Knight),Kinetic Knight,<id-00019,1,Elemental Blade,"<p>At 1st level, a kinetic knight gains the kinetic blade form infusion, and it costs 0 points of burn instead of 1 point. She can't use her kinetic blast without the kinetic blade form infusion or an infusion that lists kinetic blade as a prerequisite.</p><p>At 3rd level, the kinetic knight gains the blade rush infusion. At 5th level, she gains the kinetic whip infusion. Her kinetic whip has the disarm, performanceUC, and trip weapon qualities. At 9th level, she gains the blade whirlwind infusion.

He gains the kinetic fist form infusion and it costs 0 points of burn instead of 1 point of burn. When using the kinetic fist form infusion with a full attack, he can make a flurry of blows as the monk class feature. He must use only his fists to make this flurry, no matter what other abilities he possesses. Like a monk, he can use this ability only when unarmored, not using a shield, and unencumbered. He can't use his kinetic blast without a form infusion, nor can he ever use his kinetic blast with the chain, extended range, extreme range, foe throw, flurry of blasts, many throw, or snake form infusions, or with any other form infusion that requires a ranged attack roll or ranged touch attack roll.

,Kineticist,"[[""Kineticist""],[""Elemental Purist""]]",Kineticist (Elemental Purist),Elemental Purist,<id-00039,7,Elemental Impossibility,"<p>At 7th level, an elemental purist learns one composite blast as if she had an expanded element that matched her primary element. In addition, she learns one impossible infusion-a form infusion or substance infusion that does not need to be associated with her primary element's type. If the infusion can be applied to her kinetic blasts normally, she can use it as normal. If the infusion is not an associated infusion, she can accept 1 point of burn as a free action to enter a state of elemental impossibility for one minute. This burn cannot be reduced in any way. While in this state, she can apply her impossible infusions to her kinetic blast, even if it is not an associated infusion for the blast type; however, if an infusion can be applied only to energy blasts or only to physical blasts, she can apply it only to a kinetic blast of that type.

By accepting 1 point of burn, she can increase both bonuses by 1. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, she can accept 1 additional point of burn to further increase both bonuses by 1 (to a maximum of +7 at 17th level).

She can't choose to accept burn if doing so would raise her total number of points of burn above 3. However, a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier, as a full-round action she can gather up the soul of a sentient creature with a CR equal to or higher than her character level, as long as that creature died in the past minute. When she does, some of her existing burn is unloaded into the departing soul, racking it with unspeakable torment, but reducing her current burn total by 1 point. A soul used in this way cannot be brought back to life as if it died of a death effect. Using a soul like this doesn't heal the nonlethal damage from that point of burn immediately, but does enable the dark elementalist to heal the nonlethal damage from that point of burn normally.</p><p>At 6th level, racking a soul in this way forces anyone trying to bring the creature back to life to succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + the dark elementalist's kineticist level) or the attempt fails. At 11th level, even if the creature returns from the dead, its soul is so damaged by the agony that it takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage (or 3d10 points of sanity damage if using the sanity system found on page 12). At 16th level, the soul is destroyed in the process, and the creature can be restored only by a miracle or wish.</p><p>A dark elementalist gains attack and damage bonuses from elemental overflow based on how many times that day she has used soul power to rack a soul, rather than based on her current burn total. For instance, a 9th-level dark elementalist who used soul power to rack three or more souls during the course of the day would add a +3 bonus on attack rolls and a +6 bonus on damage rolls.

She can use wild talents of the same element that she chose in this way to meet prerequisites for these wild talents. Instead of gaining one kineticist blast, a terrakineticist chooses one simple blast from each element that has more than one simple blast.</p><p>When in a corresponding terrain, as determined by the ranger favored terrain categories, her element changes to the corresponding element (granting her class skills, basic utility wild talent, simple blast, and elemental defense as appropriate), and she gains all the wild talents she selected from the corresponding element. Aether corresponds to urban and the Ethereal Plane; air corresponds to hill, mountain, plains, and the Plane of Air; fire corresponds to desert and the Plane of Fire; earth corresponds to underground and the Plane of Earth; water corresponds to cold, swamp, water, and the Plane of Water; and wood corresponds to forest, jungle, the First World, and the Positive Energy Plane. In areas that might count as multiple types of terrain, the GM decides which element predominates, and in certain areas not covered by the ranger favored terrains (such as the upper atmosphere) or in those with strong elemental energy (like an underground temple of a fire cult), the corresponding element might differ. If the kineticist class gains additional elements, those elements also gain corresponding terrains at the GM's discretion, and the terrakineticist chooses wild talents from those elements. A terrakineticist should almost never be in a situation that doesn't correspond to any of these elements, but in such an unusual circumstance (for instance, the void of space given the standard six elements), she loses access to all her wild talents, even her universal wild talents.</p><p>When her element changes, she loses the benefits of all active wild talents from the previous element, even if it would usually last until the next time she recovers burn.

However, unlike her other wild talents, any burn she invests in one element's elemental defense carries over to her elemental defense when her element changes. For instance, if a 6th-level terrakineticist invested 2 points of burn in flesh of stone to gain 2 additional points of damage reduction and then entered a city and changed to aether, she would have 2 points of burn invested in force ward and increase the force ward's temporary hit points by 6.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg

She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion. Some infusions change the action required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects. The burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies.</p><p>The DC for a save against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective spell level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using the kineticist's Dexterity modifier instead of her Constitution modifier. When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion's effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion.

At 9th level, she can choose to bring an ally who died within 1 round back from the dead; this functions similarly to the breath of life spell. The ally regains the normal number of hit points from kinetic healer. An ally revived in this way takes 1 additional point of burn, beyond the normal 1 point of burn that either the kinetic chirurgeon or the ally must accept as a cost of the kinetic healer wild talent. At 13th level, a kinetic chirurgeon can choose to use kinetic healer on herself as a swift action. At 17th level, she can choose to heal both herself and another target with the same use of kinetic healer, although in that case, both she and her target must each accept 1 point of burn, instead of only one of them needing to do so as normal for kinetic healer. Regardless of her level, the kinetic chirurgeon can apply only one metahealer ability to a single use of kinetic healer.

Instead of gaining one kineticist blast, a terrakineticist chooses one simple blast from each element that has more than one simple blast.</p><p>When in a corresponding terrain, as determined by the ranger favored terrain categories, her element changes to the corresponding element (granting her class skills, basic utility wild talent, simple blast, and elemental defense as appropriate), and she gains all the wild talents she selected from the corresponding element. Aether corresponds to urban and the Ethereal Plane; air corresponds to hill, mountain, plains, and the Plane of Air; fire corresponds to desert and the Plane of Fire; earth corresponds to underground and the Plane of Earth; water corresponds to cold, swamp, water, and the Plane of Water; and wood corresponds to forest, jungle, the First World, and the Positive Energy Plane. In areas that might count as multiple types of terrain, the GM decides which element predominates, and in certain areas not covered by the ranger favored terrains (such as the upper atmosphere) or in those with strong elemental energy (like an underground temple of a fire cult), the corresponding element might differ. If the kineticist class gains additional elements, those elements also gain corresponding terrains at the GM's discretion, and the terrakineticist chooses wild talents from those elements.

However, unlike her other wild talents, any burn she invests in one element's elemental defense carries over to her elemental defense when her element changes. For instance, if a 6th-level terrakineticist invested 2 points of burn in flesh of stone to gain 2 additional points of damage reduction and then entered a city and changed to aether, she would have 2 points of burn invested in force ward and increase the force ward's temporary hit points by 6.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_09.jpg
