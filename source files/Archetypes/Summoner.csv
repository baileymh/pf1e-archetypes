Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Master Summoner""]]",Summoner (Master Summoner),Master Summoner,<summonerbondsenses_2,2,Augment Summoning,"<p>At 2nd level, a master summoner gains Augment Summoning as a bonus feat. He does not have to meet any requirements for this feat. This ability replaces bond senses.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Blood God Disciple""]]",Summoner (Blood God Disciple),Blood God Disciple,<summonersummonmonsteri_7,7,Avatar Gambit,"<p>At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the summon monster IV spell-like ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Blood God Disciple""]]",Summoner (Blood God Disciple),Blood God Disciple,<summonersummonmonsteri_1,1,Blood Feast,"<p>At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has.</p><p>At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Blood Summoner""]]",Summoner (Blood Summoner),Blood Summoner,<summonershieldally_4,4,Blood Offering,"<p>At 4th level, the blood summoner can sacrifice a flask of blood, extracted up to 1 day ago from a living creature or a corpse that's been dead no longer than 1 minute, to aid and appease an evil outsider within 30 feet as a standard action. This blood can be extracted from a willing or helpless creature as a full-round action that deals 1 point of Constitution damage. The offering grants the outsider a +2 enhancement bonus to the ability score of the blood summoner's choice and grants the blood summoner a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks and Charisma checks to bargain with it. The bonuses last for 10 minutes. The offering cannot be made to the same fiend twice in the same day. This ability replaces shield ally.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Blood Summoner""]]",Summoner (Blood Summoner),Blood Summoner,<summonermergeforms_16,16,Blood Possession,"<p>At 16th level as a full-round action, a blood summoner's eidolon can enter and control the body of any corporeal creature that has blood. This ability functions as marionette possessionUM, except that the eidolon's body also enters the target and the target can be unwilling. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner's level + his Charisma modifier) negates this effect. This ability can be used once per day at 16th level, twice per day at 18th level, and three times per day at 20th level. The eidolon can end this possession at any time as a standard action. If the host body is slain while the eidolon is possessing it, the eidolon is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round. This ability replaces merge forms.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Blood Summoner""]]",Summoner (Blood Summoner),Blood Summoner,<summonertransposition_8,8,Blood Travel,"<p>At 8th level, a blood summoner can use his maker's call ability to allow his eidolon to travel through the blood of other creatures instead of bringing it to his side. The eidolon can either emerge from the blood of a living creature within range that has fewer than its maximum hit points remaining, or burst from the corpse of a Small or larger creature within range that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute. If the eidolon emerges from an injured creature, that creature takes 4d6 points of damage, which is halved if the creature succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner's level + his Charisma modifier). The eidolon appears in its choice of the nearest unoccupied square to the creature or corpse it emerged from, and is staggered for 1 round. This ability replaces transposition.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Blood God Disciple""]]",Summoner (Blood God Disciple),Blood God Disciple,<summonersummonmonsteri_3,3,Bloody Gift,"<p>At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the summon monster II spell-like ability.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Evolutionist""]]",Summoner (Evolutionist),Evolutionist,<summonerbondsenses_2,2,Bond senses,"<p>At 2nd level, instead of a single eidolon, a broodmaster summons two Small eidolons to his side, each less powerful than the single eidolon of a standard summoner. Each eidolon has it own base form and associated base statistics and free evolutions. Regardless of the number of eidolons in the brood, each eidolon has the same base attack bonus and base saving throw bonuses, but the rest of the eidolons' base statistics must be divided between the eidolons, including Hit Dice (minimum 1), skill points, number of feats, armor bonus, Str/Dex bonus, evolution pool (but see below), and maximum number of natural attacks. Individual eidolons in the brood must purchase evolutions separately. Once a broodmaster decides on the forms and abilities of his eidolons, they cannot be changed until the summoner gains a level.</p><p>Example: A 2nd-level broodmaster can summon two eidolons. Each eidolon has 1 Hit Dice, BAB +2, +3 on its two good saves and +0 on its bad save. The broodmaster decides to give the first eidolon 4 skill points, one feat, a +1 armor bonus, a +1 bonus to Strength, 2 points from the evolution pool, and a maximum of two attacks. The remaining 4 skill points, +1 armor bonus, +1 bonus to Dexterity, and 2 points from the evolution pool go to the second eidolon, but it gains no feats and can have only one natural attack.</p><p>The broodmaster must dismiss all of his eidolons at one time. Likewise, all of the eidolons in a brood are banished if the broodmaster is unconscious, asleep, or killed. However, each eidolon in the brood is sent back to its home plane individually when its hit points are reduced to a negative number equal to or greater than its Constitution score. This ability replaces the summoner's normal eidolon ability.</p><p>The following are new class features of the broodmaster archetype. Those with the same name as the standard summoner class have slightly different rules, but otherwise work as and replace the standard summoner class features of the same name.</p><p>The broodmaster can only share the senses of one eidolon in his brood at a time.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Evolutionist""]]",Summoner (Evolutionist),Evolutionist,<summonerlifebond_14,14,Brood Bond,"<p>At 14th level, a summoner's life becomes linked to his brood. This functions as the life bond ability, except the broodmaster can only transfer damage to one eidolon in the brood at a time. If that eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, all excess damage remains with the broodmaster, killing him. This ability replaces life bond.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Evolutionist""]]",Summoner (Evolutionist),Evolutionist,<id-00002,2,Brood Link,"<p>At 2nd level, a broodmaster forms a close bond with his eidolons. This ability works like the standard summoner life link ability, except the broodmaster can only sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to one eidolon in the brood at a time. If two or more eidolons in the brood take enough damage to send them back to their home plane, the broodmaster can only sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to one of them. This ability replaces life link.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Pyroclast""]]",Summoner (Pyroclast),Pyroclast,<id-00003,1,Chaos Magic,"<p>A morphic savant gains the following bonus spells known at the listed spell level: 1st-protection from law, 2nd-shard of chaosUM, 3rd-magic circle against law, 4th-chaos hammer, 5th-dispel law, 6th-word of chaos. The morphic savant gains one fewer spell known per spell level for spell levels 1-6. This ability alters the summoner's spells known.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""God Caller""]]",Summoner (God Caller),God Caller,<summoneraspect_10,10,Divine Awareness,"<p>At 10th level, after 10 minutes of concentration, a god caller's eidolon can see from afar as per clairaudience/clairvoyance. The eidolon can do this once per day at 10th level, and an additional time per day every 4 summoner levels thereafter (maximum of 3 times per day at 18th level).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""God Caller""]]",Summoner (God Caller),God Caller,<summonergreateraspect_18,18,Divine Might,"<p>At 18th level, a god caller's eidolon's attacks are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and harming mythic creatures.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""God Caller""]]",Summoner (God Caller),God Caller,<summonertransposition_8,8,Divine Word,"<p>At 8th level, if a god caller's eidolon would grant him a bonus with the aid another action on a Diplomacy or Intimidate check, the god caller can instead choose to roll twice and take the better result. He makes the choice before rolling. Once per day while his eidolon uses the aid another action to assist him in such a check, if the god caller would improve a target's attitude toward him, or gain a success if using the individual influence rules (Ultimate Intrigue 102), he instead improves that target's attitude by 2 steps or it counts as 2 successes.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""First Worlder""]]",Summoner (First Worlder),First Worlder,<summonereidolon_1,1,Eidolon,"<p>A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it and can speak all of his languages. Eidolons are treated as summoned creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by <i>protection from evil </i>and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures. A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of <i>dispel magic </i>, but spells such as <i>dismissal </i>and <i>banishment </i>work normally. If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished. The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner's desires. The eidolon's Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner's class level and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon receives a pool of evolution points, based on the summoner's class level, that can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of summoner. The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the summoner's forehead as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as <i>alter self </i>or <i>polymorph </i>(although <i>invisibility </i>does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p><p>Instead of an outsider, a first worlder's eidolon has the fey creature type and the extraplanar subtype. Its statistics are changed from a standard eidolon as follows:</p><p>Hit Dice: d6 Hit Die (instead of d10).</p><p>BAB: Equal to 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice.</p><p>Good/Bad Saves: The eidolon's good saves area always Reflex and Will.</p><p>Skills: The eidolon's class skills are Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb, Craft, Diplomacy, Disguise, Escape Artist, Fly, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Perception, Perform, Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Swim, and Use Magic Device.</p><p>Senses: The eidolon gains low-light vision instead of darkvision. The summoner can grant the eidolon darkvision 60 ft. as a 1-point evolution.</p><p>Damage Reduction: If the first worlder chooses this evolution, he may select DR/cold iron instead of one of the alignment-based types of damage reduction.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Evolutionist""]]",Summoner (Evolutionist),Evolutionist,<id-00001>,2,Eidolon Brood,"<p>At 2nd level, instead of a single eidolon, a broodmaster summons two Small eidolons to his side, each less powerful than the single eidolon of a standard summoner. Each eidolon has it own base form and associated base statistics and free evolutions. Regardless of the number of eidolons in the brood, each eidolon has the same base attack bonus and base saving throw bonuses, but the rest of the eidolons’ base statistics must be divided between the eidolons, including Hit Dice (minimum 1), skill points, number of feats, armor bonus, Str/Dex bonus, evolution pool (but see below), and maximum number of natural attacks. Individual eidolons in the brood must purchase evolutions separately. Once a broodmaster decides on the forms and abilities of his eidolons, they cannot be changed until the summoner gains a level. Example: A 2nd-level broodmaster can summon two eidolons. Each eidolon has 1 Hit Dice, BAB +2, +3 on its two good saves and +0 on its bad save. The broodmaster decides to give the first eidolon 4 skill points, one feat, a +1 armor bonus, a +1 bonus to Strength, 2 points from the evolution pool, and a maximum of two attacks.

The morphic savant's eidolon has three base forms: biped, quadruped, and serpentine. Each form has the same feats and skills, but has its own set of evolutions. When the summoner meditates and regains his spell slots for the day, he can select any of the three base forms of his eidolon. The eidolon has 1 fewer evolution point than normal for an eidolon of the morphic savant's summoner level, and has 1 fewer skill point per Hit Die.

Once selected, the evolutions of the unwavering conduit's eidolon cannot be changed when a new class level is gained (though they can be altered normally with the transmogrify spell; see Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 250). At least half the eidolon's skill points must be spent on skills in which the unwavering conduit also has ranks. The eidolon gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and abilities of the conjuration, enchantment, and transmutation schools. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level, and by an additional 1 for every 3 levels thereafter.

The storm caller can expend a use of his summon storm's fury ability as a standard action to create an instantaneous line of lightning between him and his eidolon, provided that the eidolon is within 60 feet of him. The lightning arc deals the same amount of damage to all creatures in the line and has the same save DC as a bolt of lightning from the summon storm's fury ability (unlike call lightning, this damage is dealt only once). The storm caller and his eidolon are not affected by this lightning.</p><p>At 12th level, the storm caller gains the benefit of his eidolon's resistance (electricity) or immunity (electricity) evolution whenever he is within 30 feet of the eidolon.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

He can't grant an evolution that duplicates the function of, or has the same name as, any ability the summoned creatures already possess (for example, he can't grant a creature with a bite attack another bite attack), nor can he add an evolution that causes the summoned monsters to have more attacks than his eidolon's maximum number of attacks. The creatures do not have to be of the correct subtype to gain an evolution, but do have to meet any other prerequisites.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""God Caller""]]",Summoner (God Caller),God Caller,<summonertwineidolon_20,20,Overwhelming Presence,"<p>At 20th level, a god caller's eidolon can use overwhelming presence (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 230) three times per day.

Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Spirit Summoner""]]",Summoner (Spirit Summoner),Spirit Summoner,<id-00002,1,Shadow Eidolon,"<p>A shadow caller's eidolon is at once a thing of shadow called from the deep of the Shadow Plane and his own shadow; the two are inseparable. When his eidolon manifests, his shadow lengthens and finally detaches from him as a creature unto itself. For as long as the shadow caller's eidolon is manifested, he and the eidolon do not have distinct shadows, regardless of the presence or absence of light. This lack of a shadow replaces the magical symbol that identifies the summoner and his eidolon.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Spirit Summoner""]]",Summoner (Spirit Summoner),Spirit Summoner,<id-00001,1,Shadow Summoning,"<p>When a shadow caller uses his summon monster ability or casts the summon monster spell, he typically summons creatures from the Shadow Plane or creatures closely associated with shadow. When a creature on the summon monster spell list indicates that it is summoned with either the celestial or the fiendish template based on the alignment of the caster, the creature summoned by the shadow caller has the shadow creature template instead . Furthermore, the summon monster lists are modified in the following ways (these changes also apply to using a higher-level summon spell to summon multiple creatures from a lower-level list).</p><p><i>Summon Monster I: </i>No changes.</p><p><i>Summon Monster II: </i>A shadow caller cannot summon Small elementals or lemures, but instead can summon zoogs.</p><p><i>Summon Monster III: </i>A shadow caller cannot summon dretches or lantern archons, but can summon augur kytons.</p><p><i>Summon Monster IV: </i>A shadow caller cannot summon Medium elementals, hell hounds, hound archons, or mephits, but can summon allips , gloomwings , and shadows.</p><p><i>Summon Monster V: </i>A shadow caller cannot summon babau, bearded devils, bralani azatas, Large elementals, salamanders, or xills, but can summon shadow mastiffs and shae.</p><p><i>Summon Monster VI: </i>A shadow caller cannot summon Huge elementals, erinyes, lillend azatas, or succubi, but can summon cloakers.</p><p><i>Summon Monster VII: </i>A shadow caller cannot summon bebiliths, bone devils, greater elementals, or vrocks, but can summon greater shadows.</p><p>Summon Monster VIII: A shadow caller can only summon derghodaemons and young umbral dragons.</p><p>Summon Monster IX: A shadow caller can only summon interlocutor kytons and nightwings.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Storm Caller""]]",Summoner (Storm Caller),Storm Caller,<summonermakerscall_6,6,Storm's Wings,"<p>At 6th level, a storm caller can borrow some of his eidolon's elemental might. He can gain the flight evolution (Pathfinder Unchained 37) as though he were using the summoner's aspect ability, deducting 2 evolution points from the eidolon's evolution pool. If he does so, his eidolon is unable to take the flight evolution as long as the storm caller has that evolution.</p><p>At 8th level, the storm caller's eidolon can have the flight evolution even if the storm caller has that evolution.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

As a standard action while his eidolon is summoned, the story summoner can draw a random card from a complete harrow deck he owns. For a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the summoner's class level (minimum 1), the eidolon's alignment changes to match that of the harrow card drawn, and the eidolon gains a +4 enhancement bonus on the ability score linked to the drawn card's suit. The eidolon continues to follow its summoner's orders regardless of its alignment. The story summoner can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg
Summoner,"[[""Summoner""],[""Twinned Summoner""]]",Summoner (Twinned Summoner),Twinned Summoner,<summonerbondsenses_2,2,Summon Arcana,"<p>At 2nd level, a story summoner can use a complete harrow deck he owns as an additional focus component for his summon monster spell-like ability. When he does so, the summoner draws a random card from the deck and applies a simple template to the summoned monster based on the card's alignment: celestial (any good), fiendish (any evil), resolute (any lawful), or entropic (any chaotic). If a card has more than one alignment-such as a lawful evil or chaotic good card-the summoner can choose which template to apply to the summoned creature. This ability allows a story summoner to summon and command creatures normally prohibited by their alignment. This ability replaces bond senses.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

At levels where a regular summoner would gain access to a new level of summon monster as a spell-like ability, the leshy caller instead gains the equivalent summon nature's ally spell; at 19th level, she can cast summon nature's ally IX or gate. When a leshy caller gains a summon nature's ally spell as a spell-like ability, she adds it to her class spell list (though she must still select it as a spell known if she wants to gain the ability to cast it as a normal spell).

At levels where a summoner would gain a more powerful summon monster spell as a spell-like ability, he instead gains the equivalent summon nature's ally spell (at 19th level, he can use summon nature's ally IX or gate). When a first worlder gains a summon nature's ally spell as a spell-like ability, he adds it to his class spell list (he must still select it as a spell known if he wants to cast it as an actual spell).

Any creatures summoned with this ability gain immunity to electricity.</p><p>Alternatively, whenever his eidolon is not summoned, a storm caller can expend a daily use of this ability to summon a magical storm as a standard action. This functions as call lightning with a caster level equal to his summoner level, except as noted below.</p><p>Each bolt of lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage. This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level. The prevailing weather has no effect on the damage of the lightning bolts. The Reflex save DC is equal to 10 + half the storm caller's summoner level + his Charisma modifier. If the storm caller uses this ability again before he has used all of his available bolts of lightning (to summon another magical storm, to summon a monster, or to use the gate spell), any unused bolts are expended with no effect.</p><p>The storm caller adds call lightning to his summoner spell list as a 3rd-level spell and call lightning storm to automatically add them to his list of spells known.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_21.jpg

The summoner can use this ability when his eidolon is summoned. Only one summon monster spell may be in effect while the eidolon is summoned. If the summoner's eidolon is not summoned, the number of creatures that can be summoned with this ability is only limited by its uses per day. This ability otherwise functions as the summoner's normal summon monster I ability. Other than these restrictions, there is no limit to how many summon monster or gate spells the summoner can have active at one time.

If a creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, it is instead a resolute creature (Bestiary 2 293).</p><p>This also causes the unwavering conduit's summoning power to be more set than a standard summoner's. Beginning at 3rd level, each time he uses summon monster to summon multiple monsters, rather than rolling a die to see how many creatures he summons, he receives a specific number (two creatures for 1d3, or four creatures for 1d4+1). If an item, spell, or ability would increase the number of creatures summoned, the set number increases by that amount.</p><p>Also, starting at 2nd level, creatures summoned by the unwavering conduit receive a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and abilities of the conjuration, enchantment, and transmutation schools.
