,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Enigma""]]",Mesmerist (Enigma),Enigma,<id-00036,20,Absentia,"<p>At 20th level, all creatures adjacent to the enigma subconsciously ignore him. Adjacent creatures are always treated as flat-footed to the enigma and are not considered to be directly observing the enigma for the purpose of the Stealth skill. This effect ends immediately if the enigma makes a successful attack against any creature, but automatically resumes at the beginning of his next turn.</p><p>This ability replaces rule minds.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Aromaphile""]]",Mesmerist (Aromaphile),Aromaphile,<id-00017,3,Aromatic Manipulation,"<p>At 3rd level, the aromaphile can touch a creature affected by his hypnotic aroma to alter its mental state. This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued to his list of minor conditions and exhausted to his list of greater conditions.</p><p>An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. At 3rd level, he can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma. At 6th level, he can deaden the target's emotions (as per calm emotions). At 10th level, he can cause the target to become stunned. At 14th level, he can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber, except the Hit Die limit is equal to the aromaphile's level + 2). The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC = 10 + half the aromaphile's level + the aromaphile's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target gains the chosen condition for a number of rounds equal to the aromaphile's level. Each round that the target is affected, it can attempt a new Will save at the same DC to end the effect early. If the target succeeds at such a save, its turn immediately ends.</p><p>This alters touch treatment and replaces mental potency.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Thought Eater""]]",Mesmerist (Thought Eater),Thought Eater,<id-00003,1,Assume Identity,"<p>When a thought eater targets a creature with his hypnotic stare ability, the thought eater gains a bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that creature. This bonus is equal to the thought eater's mesmerist level, and lasts for 24 hours, or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.</p><p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Thought Eater""]]",Mesmerist (Thought Eater),Thought Eater,<id-00024,3,Assume Knowledge,"<p>At 3rd level, the thought eater can choose one Knowledge skill possessed by the target of his hypnotic stare. He uses the target's number of ranks in that skill, instead of his own, to calculate his bonus (but not for other purposes, such as meeting the prerequisites of feats) to a maximum number of ranks equal to his mesmerist level. This ability lasts for 24 hours or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.</p><p>This ability replaces touch treatment.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Thought Eater""]]",Mesmerist (Thought Eater),Thought Eater,<id-00018,2,Assume Morality,"<p>At 2nd level, the thought eater's alignment matches that of the target of his assume identity ability for the purposes of spells and effects that discern alignment. This includes any increase to alignment aura strength from class features, such as a cleric's aura ability.</p><p>This ability replaces towering ego.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Autohypnotist""]]",Mesmerist (Autohypnotist),Autohypnotist,<id-00032,1,Autohypnosis,"<p>At 1st level, an autohypnotist has mastered techniques that make his hypnotic stare ability more potent, but at a terrible cost-the autohypnotist succumbs to his own power when he uses it. Whenever the autohypnotist focuses his stare on an opponent, the penalties that opponent takes from the hypnotic stare (as well as any bold stare improvements or stare feats that the autohypnotist has) increase by 1. However, the autohypnotist takes the same penalties as his target while focusing his stare, including those of any bold stare improvements he has.</p><p>An autohypnotist can reduce or negate the penalty he imposes upon himself with his hypnotic stare, but doing so allows his opponent an opportunity to escape from the stare as well. The autohypnotist can reduce the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare ability by half for 1 round as a swift action. If he does so, there is a 25% chance that his hypnotic stare ends altogether. Alternatively, he can choose to negate the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare for 1 round, but his hypnotic stare then has a 50% chance of ending.</p><p>This ability alters hypnotic stare.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Vexing Daredevil""]]",Mesmerist (Vexing Daredevil),Vexing Daredevil,<id-00024,3,Bonus Feat,"<p>A vexing daredevil gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat at 3rd level, Greater Feint as a bonus feat at 6th level, and Greater Mesmerizing Feint* as a bonus feat at 10th level. She doesn't need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. At 14th level, she gains a bonus stare feat; she must meet the prerequisites of that feat. These bonus feats replace touch treatment.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Vexing Trickster""]]",Mesmerist (Vexing Trickster),Vexing Trickster,<id-00024,3,Bonus Feat,"<p>At 3rd level, a vexing trickster gains a trick feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the feat's prerequisites. At 10th level, he gains a second trick feat as a bonus feat.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Spirit Walker""]]",Mesmerist (Spirit Walker),Spirit Walker,<id-00025,6,Command Undead,"<p>At 6th level, a spirit walker gains Command Undead as a bonus feat. A spirit walker can use Command Undead a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier (minimum 1), using his mesmerist level as his cleric level. At 10th level, the DC to resist this effect increases by 2. This ability replaces the 6th- and 10th-level touch treatments.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Vox""]]",Mesmerist (Vox),Vox,<id-00032,1,Compelling Voice,"<p>A vox can focus the sound of his voice on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, sapping that target's willpower and rendering her more vulnerable to mind-affecting powers, rather than using a stare like other mesmerists. A vox can use his compelling voice even while deafened, but it has a 20% chance to fail, just like casting a spell with a verbal component. The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox's voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence). Otherwise, the vox's compelling voice has the effects of the standard mesmerist's hypnotic stare, and it gains further benefits as normal from abilities like the painful stare and bold stare class features.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Thought Eater""]]",Mesmerist (Thought Eater),Thought Eater,<id-00036,20,Consume Identity,"<p>At 20th level, when the thought eater kills a target of his hypnotic stare, he can choose to entirely consume the creature's identity, mind, body, and soul as a free action. The target's corpse dissolves and as long as the thought eater lives, the target of consume identity cannot be brought back from the dead until the thought eater releases the identity (a standard action) or uses consume identity on another target. The creature's soul can also be released by a wish or miracle (which ends the effect of consume identity). When the thought eater has consumed an identity, all divination spells identify him as (and consider him to be) the creature whose identity he consumed rather than himself. This ability fools any spell short of discern location. Discern location pinpoints the thought eater's location, whenever either the thought eater or the consumed creature is the target of that spell.</p><p>This ability replaces rule minds.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Gaslighter""]]",Mesmerist (Gaslighter),Gaslighter,<id-00003,1,Consummate Cruelty,<p>A gaslighter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) on Intimidate checks. A gaslighter can take Improved Dirty TrickAPG and Greater Dirty TrickAPG without having Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of 13. He can also ignore those two prerequisites for other feats that have Improved Dirty Trick or Greater Dirty Trick as a prerequisite.</p><p>This ability replaces consummate liar.</p>,systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Vexing Trickster""]]",Mesmerist (Vexing Trickster),Vexing Trickster,<id-00003,1,Consummate Trickster,"<p>A vexing trickster gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 3 mesmerist levels thereafter (maximum +6).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Spirit Walker""]]",Mesmerist (Spirit Walker),Spirit Walker,<id-00024,3,Continued Animation,"<p>At 3rd level, when a spirit walker is using hypnotic stare on a humanoid target and the target dies, as an immediate action the spirit walker can force the target's soul to remain in the body. The spirit walker can then control the target as if using dominate person for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the spirit walker's class level. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 x the spirit walker's class level and continues acting as though it were alive and conscious until it loses those temporary hit points or the duration expires. During this time, the creature counts as undead, but it can't be healed by negative energy. The spirit walker can use this ability once per day for every 3 mesmerist levels he possesses. The target receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spirit walker's class level + his Charisma modifier) to avoid this effect and die normally. This ability ends immediately if at any point the target's body is completely destroyed (such as by disintegrate) or restored to life. At 14th level, the spirit walker can apply this ability to any type of target as if using dominate monster. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 14th-level touch treatments.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Gaslighter""]]",Mesmerist (Gaslighter),Gaslighter,<id-00027,14,Corosion of Sanity,"<p>At 14th level, whenever a creature fails its initial saving throw against a gaslighter's singletarget mind-affecting effect, the target also takes 1 point of Wisdom damage. This has no effect on abilities that don't allow a saving throw or affect multiple targets or an area. If using the sanity system (see page 12), the target takes 2 points of sanity damage instead.</p><p>This ability replaces touch treatment (break enchantment).</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg
,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Cult Master""]]",Mesmerist (Cult Master),Cult Master,<id-00032,1,Cult Tricks,"<p>The following new tricks can be selected by a cult master. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.</p><p>Double: An illusion makes either the cult master's cohort or one of his followers appear to be him. The cult master can trigger this trick when he is targeted by an attack, provided he is adjacent to the subject, to give the attack a 50% miss chance. If the attack misses the cult master, it targets the subject instead. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</p><p>Extol: A mental compulsion causes a cohort or follower to extol the virtues of the cult master. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he attempts a Diplomacy check, as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject takes the aid another action on the cult master's Diplomacy check. If the subject is successful, the cult master gains a +4 bonus on his check.

,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Vexing Daredevil""]]",Mesmerist (Vexing Daredevil),Vexing Daredevil,<id-00019,3,Dazzling Feint,"<p>At 3rd level, each time a vexing daredevil successfully feints against a creature under the effect of her hypnotic stare, she also chooses one of her dazzling feint benefits to activate. Unless otherwise stated, a dazzling feint's benefit applies only on the vexing daredevil's next attack this round. She selects one dazzling feint at 3rd level and another every 4 levels thereafter. The DC for any saving throw against a dazzling feint's effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vexing daredevil's class level + her Charisma modifier. The vexing daredevil can't choose the same dazzling feint more than once.</p><p>Blinding Strike: The vexing daredevil's weapon emits a bright flash of light into the opponent's eyes. If the vexing daredevil's next attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.</p><p>Combat Maneuver: The vexing daredevil's attack patterns become more difficult to discern. The vexing daredevil chooses one combat maneuver when making this dazzling feint. For the rest of the round, she doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity when performing that combat maneuver against the target of her dazzling feint. This dazzling feint benefit applies on combat maneuvers instead of on the vexing daredevil's next attack.</p><p>Critical Strike: Ever alert, the vexing daredevil hones in on the target's weak points. If her next attack is a critical threat against the target of this dazzling feint, the vexing daredevil gains a circumstance bonus on the roll to confirm that critical hit equal to +1 for every 3 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p><p>Outmanuever: The vexing daredevil's darting movements foil the target's attempts to box her in. If her next attack hits, the vexing daredevil gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through the target's space or threatened area for 1 round. She can also move up to half her speed after the attack hits as a free action. If she wants to use Acrobatics to move through the target's threatened area or an enemy's space during this movement, she must reduce her speed or the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 10, as normal.</p><p>Piercing Strike: By psychically amplifying the target's pain, the vexing daredevil causes more damage. If she hits with her next attack and deals damage with her painful stare, she increases the damage dice from d6s to d8s.</p><p>Sloppy Defense: The vexing daredevil's attacks effortlessly penetrate the target's defenses; she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next attack roll for every 5 mesmerist levels she possesses.</p><p>Surprise Strike: The vexing daredevil creates an opening so she can squeeze in another strike. If her next attack hits, she can make another attack at her highest attack bonus - 5 as a free action. The vexing daredevil must be at least 7th level to select this dazzling feint.

,Mesmerist,"[[""Mesmerist""],[""Aromaphile""]]",Mesmerist (Aromaphile),Aromaphile,<id-00019,3,Debilitating Aroma,"<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, an aromaphile can imbue his hypnotic aroma with other effects. These effects are the same as those listed within the bold stare mesmerist class feature, but they affect creatures affected by his hypnotic aroma for as long as they are affected by that ability. The aromaphile chooses one option each time he gains a new debilitating aroma improvement, and the choice can't be changed later.

A creature using this sort of magic against the enigma must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + the enigma's class level to succeed (as if the enigma was under the effect of a nondetection spell); failure means the magic fails to detect the enigma, as if he did not exist.</p><p>This ability replaces glib lie.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg

At the same time, she begins able to use fey veils to assist herself and her allies in befuddling and bewitching their opponents. She can use her fey veils a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the fey trickster calls up a veil over herself ). If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. t 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute.

This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and there is no saving throw. The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter's Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own.

This functions in all ways like implanting a mesmerist trick in a creature, except the target is an object. The projectionist can trigger the trick as a standard action at any time-upon doing so, his consciousness leaves his body and fills the target object, functioning as described by the 'filling an image with your consciousness' use of the enter image spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 219). Use the projectionist's mesmerist level as the spell's caster level.

Using revision is a standard action (or a swift action if the material manipulator uses it on himself ), and the material manipulator must be able to touch his target. An unwilling target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the material manipulator's mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.</p><p>At 3rd level, the material manipulator can adjust the target's height and weight, increasing it or decreasing it to any height or weight within the standard range for creatures of the target's type and size category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169). At 6th level, he can adjust the target's gender, physical traits (such as nose size, fingernail length, and foot shape), and pigmentation (including eye, hair, and skin color) to any natural variation for creatures of the target's type (and heritage, if applicable). At 10th level, he can adjust the target's age, rewinding the target's age to as young as a young adult (approximately 8 years old for a human) or progressing it to as old as venerable. This causes the target to gain aging bonuses and penalties and adjust its size as appropriate for its new age, but doesn't confer any other benefits gained from aging (such as additional racial Hit Dice, supernatural abilities, and so on). At 14th level, he can adjust the target's type or subtype, as per polymorph. At 20th level, he can instead adjust the target's type as per greater polymorph. This ability is a polymorph effect, and the subject of a revision cannot end the effect early by any means unless the material manipulator permits it. The material manipulator can stack multiple adjustments from this ability into the same polymorph effect-for instance, a 14th-level material manipulator can adjust himself into an orc, reduce his age to that of a young adult, give himself large feet and a bulbous nose, and change his gender.</p><p>This effect lasts for 10 minutes per mesmerist level. At 10th level, the effect lasts for 1 hour per mesmerist level, or 1 minute per level if he uses it as polymorph. At 20th level, the effect lasts indefinitely, or 10 minutes per mesmerist level if the material manipulator uses it as greater polymorph and causes the target to assume a form with a different type than its true form. The mesmerist can dismiss this effect as a free action.</p><p>Clothing and equipment worn by the target is not affected by this effect-gear does not resize to suit the wearer's new form, nor does it merge into her body. Gear unable to be worn or wielded as a result of this effect falls to the ground in the wearer's space.</p><p>This ability replaces touch treatment and rule minds.</p>",systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_10.jpg

The umbral mesmerist can use this ability as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). The creatures summoned are only partly real, but have normal effects unless a creature affected by the illusion succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve (as per shadow conjuration.) The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the umbral mesmerist's mesmerist level + the umbral mesmerist's Charisma modifier. This is an illusion with the shadowUM descriptor.</p><p>A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it is recognized as a shadow creature). It deals the normal amount of damage and has all of the base creature's normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is halved, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are halved. A creature that succeeds at its save to disbelieve sees the summoned creature as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell. The umbral mesmerist cannot use this ability to summon creatures from more than one summon monster spell in this way at one time.</p><p>At 4th level and every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing the umbral mesmerist to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster VI at 20th level).

Until the enigma's next turn, the enigma gains the effects of concealment against that creature (unless it can see invisible creatures). Starting on the enigma's next turn, he gains the effect of invisibility against that creature. These effects last as long as the enigma continues to use his hypnotic stare, but if he takes an action that would end invisibility, it ends his hypnotic stare immediately. The enigma can reinstate this effect whenever he wishes, but each time it begins with 1 round of concealment. At 8th level, attacks that would end invisibility do not end the enigma's hypnotic stare, and after 1 round of concealment, he gains the benef its of greater invisibility against the target of his stare.
