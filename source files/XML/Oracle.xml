					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<level type="number">1</level>
				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

					<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, a psychic searcher gains an inspiration pool, as the investigator class ability. A psychic searcher uses her oracle level as her investigator level to determine the effects of this ability. She gains free uses of inspiration on Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana, history, local, nobility, planes, religion), and Sense Motive skill checks without spending a use of inspiration, provided she&#146;s trained in that skill. A psychic searcher&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, usually when she refreshes her spells. A psychic searcher&#146;s inspiration pool is based on her Charisma modifier, not her Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces the mystery spell gained at 2nd level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A psychic searcher is devoted to revealing the hidden within the world around her by sensing and communing with residual mental energy, haunts, and fragments of living spirits that can dwell in objects or rooms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Augury (4th), locate object (6th), divination (8th), find the path (12th), discern location (16th), foresight (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s normal mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a psychic searcher gains an inspiration pool, as the investigator class ability. A psychic searcher uses her oracle level as her investigator level to determine the effects of this ability. She gains free uses of inspiration on Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana, history, local, nobility, planes, religion), and Sense Motive skill checks without spending a use of inspiration, provided she&#146;s trained in that skill. A psychic searcher&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, usually when she refreshes her spells. A psychic searcher&#146;s inspiration pool is based on her Charisma modifier, not her Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces the mystery spell gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Psychic Talent (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a psychic searcher&#146;s mastery of her supernatural insight grows, granting her a new investigator talent from the following list: amazing inspiration, eidetic recollection, empathy, inspired alertness, item lore, perceptive tracking (except using Sense Motive instead of Perception or Survival), rogue talent (only for hard to foolAPG), and tenacious inspiration. Whenever a psychic searcher can select a new revelation, she can instead select an investigator or rogue talent from the above list. This ability replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some oracles are possessed by spirits, demons, or similar beings. Instead of the possessed oracle drawing her powers from deities, these otherworldly forces work their magic through her.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>ventriloquism (2nd), spider climb (4th), screech (6th), sleepwalk (8th), telekinesis (10th), animate objects (12th), divine vessel (16th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s normal mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A possessed oracle must choose the haunted or tongues curse at 1st level.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A possessed oracle must take the following revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Two Minds (Su): </i>You gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells or effects. At 7th level, you may reroll a failed Will save once per day as an immediate action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>

					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a warsighted can use a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The warsighted must otherwise meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her oracle level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A warsighted&#146;s unique gifts are not in strange magical revelations, but in her ability to adapt in the midst of a battle with new fighting techniques. The warsighted is a master of combat, as dedicated as a fighter and as flexible as a brawler.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a warsighted can use a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The warsighted must otherwise meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her oracle level.</p>
			<p>The warsighted can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (for example, Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At later levels, when she gains multiple feats through this ability, she can use those feats to meet the prerequisites of other feats she gains with this ability. Doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefits of three combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the revelations gained at 1st, 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Tree souls develop an affinity not just with trees but also with objects carved from them, feeling the essence of the tree&#146;s spirit living within. By bonding to trees, they learn to manipulate the trees&#146; power to produce divine energy. The type of tree a tree soul oracle bonds to often seems to influence the oracle&#146;s personality. A tree soul who is bound to a towering redwood may value traditions and be slow to anger, while a tree soul bound to a smaller pine tree might be quick to react and have a somewhat prickly personality. Regardless of the trees they form their metaphysical attachment to, tree soul oracles tend to be steadfast and stubborn, having an aura of timelessness even as the world changes around them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Tree souls are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A tree soul can also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Tree souls are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but can use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A tree soul who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast oracle spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A tree soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Transform Wood (Su): </i><b>At 1st level, as a standard action you can temporarily transform a number of 5-foot cubes of wood each day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. The wood takes on the quality of darkwood for 1 minute per oracle level. At 11th level, you can have it instead take on the quality of living steel for the same duration.</b></p>
			<p><i>Living Steel Dolls (Ex): </i>At 11th level, you add animate objects to your list of spells known. When you cast this spell on wooden objects, the objects&#146; wooden parts immediately transform into living steel. If the objects are destroyed or the duration ends, the wooden parts revert back to their original material.</p>
			<p><b>Tree Bound Curse (Su): </b>You bind your power to a specific tree. Any damage to the tree deals the same amount of damage to you, overcoming DR, energy resistance, and immunities. Damage you take in this way cannot be healed by normal or magical means until your bonded tree is healed or destroyed. The damage can reduce you to 0 hit points but not below. If the tree is destroyed, you are considered to be staggered and are unable to cast oracle spells or use supernatural or spell-like class abilities until you bond with a new tree in a ceremony that takes 12 hours to complete. Once per month, you can create a new bond with a different tree in a ceremony at that tree that takes 12 hours to complete. You lose your bond with your previous tree in the process.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Warp wood (2nd), tree stride (10th), ironwood (12th), changestaff (14th), repel metal or stone (16th), greater siege of trees (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Tree Soul Revelation (Su): </b>At 20th level, your skin takes on the appearance and properties of a tree trunk. This bark-like skin grants you a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and DR 10/slashing. You also regrow any severed limbs except your head within 24 hours as per regenerate. Finally, once a day as a standard action, you can assume the form of a treant, as per plant shape III, for a number of minutes equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some oracles seek meaning in the pattern of the stars across the night sky, the trails of comets, and the eternal orbits of the planets.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>faerie fire (2nd), glitterdust (4th), guiding star (6th), wandering star motes (8th), meteor swarm (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A stargazer must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Guiding Star (Su): </i>As the heavens mystery revelation. You must take this revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Star Chart (Ex): </i>As the heavens mystery revelation. You must take this revelation at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Through her exploration of the universe&#146;s mysteries, a spirit guide opens connections to the spirit world and forms bonds with the entities that inhabit it.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Bonded Spirit (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a spirit guide can form a temporary bond with a spirit, as the shaman&#146;s wandering spirit class feature (see page 37). She must make this selection each day when she refreshes her spells. A spirit guide cannot bond with a spirit that is incompatible with her alignment, ethos, or mystery (GM&#146;s discretion).</p>
			<p>A spirit guide gains one hex of her choice from the list of hexes available from that spirit. She uses her oracle level as her shaman level, and she switches Wisdom for Charisma and vice versa for the purpose of determining the hex's effects.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, she adds the bonded spirit&#146;s spirit magic spells to her oracle spells known for that day, but only of spell levels she can cast. At 7th level, she gains the spirit ability of her current bonded spirit. At 15th level, she gains the greater spirit ability of her current bonded spirit.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the revelations gained at 3rd, 7th, and 15th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

The number of points in the shigenjo&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/3 her oracle level + her Charisma modifier. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the shigenjo possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ki points gained from the shigenjo class stack with those gained from the other class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is permanent. The shigenjo can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
					<p>As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, a shigenjo can make a ki strike as a monk whose level is equal to her oracle level &#150; 3. As a swift action, she may spend 1 point of ki to gain one of the following benefits.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The shigenjo walks the path of enlightenment and transcendence by seeking oneness with the celestial spirits. In doing so, she unlocks the martial potential of her own spiritual power. A shigenjo has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Tengu Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>true strike (2nd), alter self (4th), divine power (8th), magic jar (12th), ki shout (14th, ), moment of prescience (16th). These bonus spells replace the shigenjo&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 7th level, a shigenjo gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the shigenjo&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/3 her oracle level + her Charisma modifier. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the shigenjo possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ki points gained from the shigenjo class stack with those gained from the other class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is permanent. The shigenjo can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
			<p>As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, a shigenjo can make a ki strike as a monk whose level is equal to her oracle level &#150; 3. As a swift action, she may spend 1 point of ki to gain one of the following benefits.</p>
			<p>Ki Magic: Add +1 to the DC of the next spell she casts on her turn.</p>
			<p>Ki Curse: Treat her oracle level as 5 higher for the purpose of determining the effects of her curse for the next round.</p>
			<p>Ki Insight: Gain a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the shigenjo&#146;s 7th-level revelation.</p>
			<p><b>Quivering Palm (Su): </b>At 15th level, a shigenjo may learn quivering palm as the monk ability of the same name in place of a revelation. She treats her oracle level as her monk level for this ability, and the DC is based on her Charisma bonus instead of her Wisdom bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, you achieve true enlightenment and becomes one with the celestial spirits. You gain the ability to speak with any creature that uses a language. For a number of days equal to your Wisdom score, you can ignore the negative effects of extreme weather, starvation, thirst, and exhaustion. If you die, your powerful connection to the celestial realm allows you to be reborn 3 days later (as reincarnate). This replaces the final revelation of the shigenjo&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While all oracles possess some ability at divination, the seer is a true prophet, able to see things as they really are, or will be.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>detect thoughts (4th), clairaudience/clairvoyance (6th), scrying (8th), true seeing (10th), legend lore (12th), greater scrying (14th), vision (16th), foresight (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A seer must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Natural Divination (Ex): </i>As the nature mystery revelation. You must take this revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Gift of Prophecy (Su): </i>Once per day, you can enter a trance to gain a glimpse of the future. This trance lasts for 1 minute, which must be uninterrupted and during which you can take no other actions. At 3rd level, you gain the benefits of an augury spell with 90% effectiveness. At 5th level, you gain the benefits of a divination spell with 90% effectiveness. At 9th level, the knowledge you gain is equivalent to a commune spell. None of these spell effects require material components. You must take this revelation at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical items in order to learn more about their oracle mysteries or sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and weird, a seeker gains Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also possesses levels in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels stack with his oracle or sorcerer levels for determining his overall bonus on these skill checks. For an oracle, this ability replaces all of the bonus class skills he would otherwise normally gain from his mystery. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces his bonus Eschew Materials feat.</p>

					<p>At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his mystery or bloodline spells with metamagic. When a seeker applies a metamagic feat to any bonus spells granted by his mystery or his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat&#146;s spell level adjustment by 1. Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only increases the spell&#146;s effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not stack with similar reductions from other abilities. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 15th level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 15th level.</p>

Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Oracles and sorcerers gain their magical powers through strange and mysterious ways, be they chosen by fate or blood. While most might be content with their strange powers, some oracles and sorcerers join the Pathfinders specifically to find out more about their mysteries and bloodlines and determine the genesis and history of their eldritch talents. These spellcasters are known among the Spells as seekers, after their obsession with researching ancient texts and obscure ruins for any clues they can find about their heritage and histories. A seeker has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Tinkering (Ex): </b>Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical items in order to learn more about their oracle mysteries or sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and weird, a seeker gains Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also possesses levels in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels stack with his oracle or sorcerer levels for determining his overall bonus on these skill checks. For an oracle, this ability replaces all of the bonus class skills he would otherwise normally gain from his mystery. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces his bonus Eschew Materials feat.</p>
			<p><b>Seeker Lore (Ex): </b>By 3rd level, a seeker has already learned much about his mystery or bloodline, and is more comfortable using the bonus spells gained by that mystery or bloodline. He gains a +4 bonus on all concentration checks, on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance, and on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks made on topics associated with his bonus spells. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Seeker Magic (Su): </b>At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his mystery or bloodline spells with metamagic. When a seeker applies a metamagic feat to any bonus spells granted by his mystery or his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat&#146;s spell level adjustment by 1. Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only increases the spell&#146;s effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not stack with similar reductions from other abilities. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 15th level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>River soul oracles derive their powers from their bonds with rivers, whether these waterways are rapid cascades or lazy channels plied by boats. The powerful bond formed with a river is also the river soul oracle&#146;s curse, as he must always carry water from the river with him, and his fate is bound to it. River soul oracles can be gentle and still when calm, but they&#146;re raging torrents when angered.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A river soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>River Flow (Su): </i>At 1st level, as a free action while you are underwater, you can negate the penalties you take for making bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing melee attacks underwater. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The rounds do not have to be used consecutively. River Form (Su): At 11th level, you can become one with a river. Once a day as a standard action, while immersed in a river, you can completely merge with it. Your body and all your gear meld into the water, as per meld into stone, except abilities that control or shape water expel you and deal you 5d6 damage rather than abilities that control or shape stone. You travel along with the river at the rate it is currently moving. You can remain in this form a number of hours equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Transforming back to your normal form is a swift action.</p>
			<p><b>River Soul Revelation (Su): </b>At 20th level, you strengthen your ties to the river with which you bonded. While traveling on or immersed in the river, you gain fast healing 10 and immunity to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Additionally, if you are slain and your body or some part of your body (including your ashes, if applicable) is floated down the river in a specially prepared vessel costing 5,000 gp, you return to life as per resurrection once you reach the mouth of the river, as long as the trip has taken 24 hours or longer..</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A reincarnated oracle draws her knowledge and power from the experiences of her previous lives. Her memories guide her through a spiritual ascension leading the way to her ultimate incarnation. A reincarnated oracle has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Samsaran Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>see alignment (2nd), detect thoughts (4th), contact other plane (10th), moment of prescience (16th), overwhelming presence (18th). These spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A reincarnated oracle must choose the haunted or tongues curse at 1st level.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A reincarnated oracle must take the following revelations at one of the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Location Memories (Su): </i>As a swift action, you may search your past lives for memories of or insight about your current location. This grants you the scent ability, low-light vision, and a +2 insight bonus on Perception and Survival checks for 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st level or 3rd level.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit Memories (Su): </i>Once per day, you call upon the unfulfilled desires and goals of your past lives and project their frustration and despair through your eyes at a target. This is a gaze attack affecting one creature. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier) or be sickened and staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st, 3rd, or 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The purifier seeks out signs of possession or mind control that manifest from unwilling (and often unwitting) servants for fiendish corruptors and their mortal minions. A purifier seeks liberation of mind, body, and spirit from the bondage of sin and the taint of the unholy. A purifier gains the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Aasimar Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>veil of heaven (2nd), confess (4th), cast out (6th), denounce (8th), dispel evil (10th), banishment (12th), holy word (14th), mind blank (16th), freedom (18th).</p>
			<p><b>Diminished Spellcasting: </b>A purifier can use one fewer spell per day of each level and does not automatically learn cure or inflict spells. Her number of oracle spells known is unchanged.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A purifier must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>See Sin (Sp): </i>At 3rd level, a purifier gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her oracle level on Sense Motive checks to sense enchantments, which she can make as a full-round action. She also gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her oracle level on Spellcraft checks to identify enchantment school spells and spells with the curse or emotion descriptor (see page 251 of for spells in the and that have the curse or emotion descriptor).</p>
			<p><i>Celestial Armor (Su): </i>At 7th level, a purifier&#146;s armor takes on a golden or silvery sheen and becomes light as a feather. Her armor weighs half as much as long as she wears it, and she also gains armor training as a fighter 4 levels lower than her oracle level. At 11th level, a purifier gains heavy armor proficiency.</p>
			<p><i>Sin Eater (Su): </i>At 11th level, a purifier can consume a curse, enchantment, or emotion effect by touch as a full-round action. She can do this a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier, and must make a Charisma check with a bonus equal to her oracle level against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect (or the Hit Dice of the creator for a supernatural effect). If the check succeeds, the effect is negated; however, the purifier is sickened for 1d4 rounds.</p>
			<p>If the target is possessed (such as by a magic jar effect or a ghost&#146;s malevolence ability), the possessor is forced out on a successful check. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the possessor is sickened for 2d4 rounds.</p>
			<p><b>Sacred Scourge (Su): </b>At 5th level, a purifier may channel holy power to harm evil outsiders as a cleric of her level using the Alignment Channel feat. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Holy Terror (Su): </b>At 9th level, a purifier may use her sacred scourge to panic evil outsiders as if using the Turn Undead feat against undead.</p>
			<p><b>Celestial Master (Su): </b>At 13th level, a purifier may use her sacred scourge to compel good outsiders to serve her, as if using the Command Undead feat against undead.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A planar oracle has an affinity with one of the Outer Planes. She is at home on the multiple planes of the Great Beyond, and can eventually become an outsider herself.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>endure elements (2nd), elemental speech (4th), tongues (6th), planar adaptation (8th), plane shift (10th), mass planar adaptation (12th), shadow walk (14th), etherealness (16th), gate (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, you must choose one Outer Plane with which you have an affinity. This choice cannot be changed. A planar oracle must take the following revelation at 3rd level.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, you become an extraplanar creature. Choose one outer plane, such as Heaven or the Abyss. You gain superficial physical characteristics as appropriate to natives of your chosen outer plane. For example, if your chosen plane is Heaven, you gain angelic features such as a halo and metallic skin. This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Your type changes to &#147;outsider (extraplanar),&#148; except on your associated plane, where your type is &#147;outsider (native).&#148; In addition, you gain immunity to your associated energy type and gain damage reduction 10/magic. Unlike other outsiders, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type. This replaces the final revelation of the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

					<p>A Pei Zin practitioner combines alchemy, acupuncture, and divine magic to heal wounds by touch. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, she uses positive energy to heal the target of 1d6 hit points for every 2 oracle levels she has. Using this ability is a standard action unless the oracle targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Using this ability requires only one free hand. This ability counts as a paladin&#146;s lay on hands ability for the purposes of feats, spells, and effects that work with that class feature when it is used for healing purposes. Unlike lay on hands, this ability cannot be used to harm undead.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In distant Tian Xia, herbalists practice an obscure alchemical art known as Pei Zin herbalism, which involves medicinal and restorative techniques that are used throughout much of that continent. A few practitioners develop a talent for Pei Zin that transcends ordinary alchemy, allowing them to blur the line between applying alchemical medicine and coaxing divine miracles.</i></p>
			<p><i>Like other masters of the art, Pei Zin practitioners can use the Profession (herbalist) skill in place of Craft (alchemy) to create alchemical remedies with recipes that include certain plant-derived reagents. More information is on pages 24&#150;25 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Healer&#146;s Way (Su): </b>A Pei Zin practitioner combines alchemy, acupuncture, and divine magic to heal wounds by touch. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, she uses positive energy to heal the target of 1d6 hit points for every 2 oracle levels she has. Using this ability is a standard action unless the oracle targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Using this ability requires only one free hand. This ability counts as a paladin&#146;s lay on hands ability for the purposes of feats, spells, and effects that work with that class feature when it is used for healing purposes. Unlike lay on hands, this ability cannot be used to harm undead.</p>
			<p><b>Master Herbalist (Su): </b>A Pei Zin practitioner has mastered countless alchemical techniques that supplement her divine powers and greatly aid her when she heals the sick and wounded. She gains a competence bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1), and uses her Charisma modifier in place of her Wisdom modifier when attempting Profession (herbalist) checks. Additionally, a Pei Zin practitioner can identify potions as if via detect magic using Profession (herbalist) instead of Spellcraft, and she can attempt such a check after holding a potion for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Master Healing Technique (Su): </b>At 7th level, whenever a Pei Zin practitioner heals a living creature with her healer&#146;s way ability, as a free action she can attempt a Profession (herbalist) check to remove a condition from the target, with each condition having an accompanying Profession (herbalist) DC (see the list below). She cannot take 10 or 20 on this check, nor can she receive aid from any creature except another Pei Zin practitioner (though the practitioner need not be an oracle; see pages 24&#150;25 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual). Failure by 5 or more causes the target to become sickened for 1 round (if the Pei Zin practitioner is attempting to remove the sickened condition, this extends it by 1 round). Similarly, failure by 10 or more instead causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round or to have its existing nauseated condition extended by 1 round. A creature that cannot be sickened or nauseated cannot have conditions removed by this ability.</p>
			<p><i>Minor Conditions (DC 20): </i>Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</p>
			<p><i>Major Conditions (DC 25): </i>Dazed and staggered.</p>
			<p><i>Severe Conditions (DC 30): </i>Confused, exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</p>
			<p><i>Dire Conditions (DC 35): </i>Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the revelation gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Although many merfolk claim deep connections to both art and the natural world, a rare few merfolk can manipulate the forces of nature and weave them into song. An ocean&#146;s echo is a merfolk gifted with the powers of an oracle and a singing voice that evokes the legendary tales of merfolk virtuosos.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Sound burst (4th), shout (8th), song of discord (10th), greater shout (12th), and pied pipingAPG (14th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiring Song (Ex): </b>The voice of an ocean&#146;s echo provides inspiration to allies. This ability is identical to bardic performance (using Perform [sing] only), allowing her to inspire courage at 1st level, inspire competence at 3rd level, and inspire heroics at 15th level, as a bard of the ocean&#146;s echo&#146;s level. It is usable a total number of rounds per day equal to her level + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the revelations gained at 1st, 3rd, and 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Keleshite prophets help guide and serve the vast Padishah Empire of Kelesh and its interests across Golarion.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (dance) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>A Keleshite prophet gains the following bonus spells: clairaudience/clairvoyance (6th), prying eyes (10th), true seeing (12th), prediction of failureUM (16th), foresight (18th).</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A Keleshite prophet must take the following revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Divining Dance (Su) </i>Once per day, you can perform a sacred meditative dance that gives you great clarity of mind and prepares you for what lies ahead. This dance must last for at least 1 minute, uninterrupted, and you can take no other actions during the dance.</p>
			<p>When you dance, attempt a Perform (dance) check; the results of the check determine the benefits you gain for the next 24 hours, as listed below. You can always choose the benefit from a lower result, if you wish (for example, if your Perform [dance] result is 15, you can choose to gain a +1 bonus on your divinations&#146; saving throws instead of choosing to use augury once as a spell-like ability).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An inerrant voice serves as a spiritual advisor to either a monarch or noble. Most Qadiran nobles retain one&#146;s services, for both guidance and protection.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>An inerrant voice gains the following bonus spells: shield other (2nd), augury (4th), divination (8th), vision (14th).</p>
			<p>These replace the bonus spells at those levels gained from the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>An inerrant voice must take the following revelation at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><i>Vigilant Protector (Su): </i>Each day when you recover your spells, you can select a specific person you know other than yourself as your ward. When your ward becomes the target of an attack or spell and you are aware of the attack, you can cast an abjuration spell you know on the ally as an immediate action. You must expend the appropriate spell slot and be able to target the ally as normal for the spell. At 11th level, as an immediate action when you know your ward is targeted, you can transpose yourself with your ward, teleporting into the original target&#146;s square (and becoming the new target of the attack or spell) while your ally is teleported into yours; this is a teleportation effect that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use this revelation once per day, plus an additional time at 7th level and every 4 oracle levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A hermit is a recluse who gained her oracular powers from isolation in a deep desert, on a mountain peak, or in another secluded location. A connection to untraveled places gives the hermit powers to evade his enemies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Blindness/deafness (4th), crushing despair (8th), wall of force (12th), maze (16th).</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>A hermit must choose a mystery that adds Survival to his list of class skills, such as nature or stone.</p>
			<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A hermit must choose the reclusive curse (below) at 1st level.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A hermit must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Recluse&#146;s Stride (Su): </i>Your base speed increases by 10 feet. At 5th level, once per round when leaving a square, you can treat the square as though it isn&#146;t threatened by any opponents that you can see. At 10th level, you can teleport a distance equal to your base land speed (as per dimension door) as a move action, provided that there are no other creatures within 10 feet of you when you use this ability and no other creatures within 10 feet of your destination. You can teleport a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Fade from Memory (Su) </i>At 7th level, whenever there are no creatures within 10 feet of you at the end of your turn, you gain 20% concealment until the beginning of your next turn as a free action. At 14th level, you instead gain 50% concealment until the beginning of your next turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your oracle level. You must take this revelation at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The enlightened philosopher seeks enlightenment through compassion, moderation, and humility. By following her philosophy&#146;s teachings, the enlightened philosopher seeks to reach enlightenment and become one with the universe.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>owl&#146;s wisdom (4th), water walk (6th), discern lies (8th), true seeing (10th), wind walk (12th), ethereal jaunt (14th), moment of prescience (16th), astral projection (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>An enlightened philosopher must take the following revelation at 7th level.</p>
			<p><i>Mental Acuity (Ex): </i>As the lore mystery revelation.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>Upon achieving 20th level, you achieve true enlightenment and become one with the universe. You receive a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier. You become immune to confusion, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, and sickened effects. You can take 20 on all Knowledge skill checks. Should you die, you are reborn 3 days later as a living example of the summoning of your chosen philosophy (treat as the reincarnate spell). This replaces the final revelation of the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An elementalist oracle shares an affinity with the elements and elemental creatures. She can communicate with elemental creatures and can eventually become an elemental herself. She sees perfection in manifestations of elemental fury in the natural world, be they the thunderous wrath of the storm, the churning waters of the ocean&#146;s tides or a flooding river, the terrain-shaping power of a landslide or earthquake, or the apocalyptic fury of a volcanic eruption.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Elemental touch (4th), protection from energy (6th), elemental body I (8th), summon monster V (elementals only; 10th), elemental body III (12th), elemental swarm (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>An elementalist oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Elemental Linguist (Su): </i>At 1st level, you gain a bonus language of your choice from the following list: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran. At 5th, 10th, and 15th levels, you gain another language chosen from this list.</p>
			<p><i>Elemental Form (Su): </i>At 11th level, you gain the air, earth, fire, or water subtype and an associated ability:</p>
			<list>
				<li>Air: Fly speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability.</li>
				<li>Earth: Tremorsense with a range of 30 feet.</li>
				<li>Fire: Immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold.</li>
				<li>Water: Swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe underwater.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Elemental Revelation (Su): </b>At 20th level, you fully harness the power of the elements. You can apply the Elemental Spell metamagic feat to spells you cast without increasing the level or casting time. You can choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire each time you use this ability. Whenever you score a critical hit with an attack that deals energy damage, you ignore the target&#146;s energy resistance (if any). If you score such a critical hit against a creature that has immunity to the energy type you are attacking with, the creature takes half damage from the attack.</p>
			<p>This replaces final revelation.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>All oracles are cursed to some degree, but some oracles bear an even heavier burden. Though doubly afflicted with supernatural or physical hindrances, a dual-cursed oracle can manipulate fortune and gains greater insights into her mystery.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). A dual-cursed oracle gains no additional class skills from her mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>ill omen (2nd), oracle&#146;s burden (4th), bestow curse (6th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A dual-cursed oracle must choose two curses at 1st level. One of these curses (oracle&#146;s choice) never changes its abilities as the oracle gains levels; for example, an oracle with clouded vision never gains darkvision 60 feet, blindsense, or blindsight. The other curse comes with its normal benefits.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A dual-cursed oracle gains a new revelation at 5th level and 13th level. These are in addition to the normal revelations she receives at 3rd level, 7th level, and so on. In addition, the cursed oracle may select the following revelations in place of a mystery revelation.</p>
			<p><i>Misfortune (Ex): </i>At 1st level, as an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 feet to reroll any one d20 roll that it has just made before the results of the roll are revealed. The creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it&#146;s worse than the original roll. Once a creature has suffered from your misfortune, it cannot be the target of this revelation again for 1 day.</p>
			<p><i>Fortune (Ex): </i>At 5th level, as an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll that you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it&#146;s worse than the original roll. You can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every six oracle levels beyond 5th.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>At 7th level, the divine numerologist&#146;s mastery of the divine mathematics allows her to set specific parameters in the divine equation to adjust the outcome of an event right as it is about to occur. As an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the divine numerologist can take the average of a single roll of one or more dice, averaging each die separately (for example, the average of a d20 roll is 10, the average of 3d6 is 9, and so on). When using this ability, the divine numerologist can add any modifiers to the roll as normal.</p>
					<p>The divine numerologist must decide to use this ability immediately before the roll she chooses to affect, and the divine numerologist cannot reroll this roll, even if she has a feat or another ability that would normally allow her to do so.</p>
					<p>The divine numerologist can use this ability once per day at 7th level and twice per day at 11th level. At 15th level, the divine numerologist can use this ability three times per day, and instead of treating a roll as its average, she can instead treat the roll as its maximum result (for example, the divine numerologist can treat a d20 roll as if the result were 20).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Oracular Council of Po Li and those trained in their sacred methods often include divine numerologists, who use esoteric mathematics and numbers traditions to peer into the past and future and extract meaningful portents. The divine numerologist&#146;s ultimate goal is to learn and understand the patterns in the equations and algorithms that underscore even the most chaotic forms of reality and use them to their personal advantage.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Prying eyes (10th), numerological evocation (12th), greater arcane sight (14th), moment of prescience (16th), foresight (18th).</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, a divine numerologist understands the math behind the entirety of existence well enough to significantly tweak her own personal fate. The divine numerologist ceases aging. She no longer suffers age-related penalties to ability scores and cannot be magically aged. Additionally, once per day when the divine numerologist or another allied creature within 30 feet of her threatens a critical hit, the critical hit is automatically confirmed.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A cyclopean seer draws power from the mysterious prophetic abilities of ancient giants.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Assume Fate (Su): </b>As an immediate action when targeted by an effect that requires a saving throw, you can choose another creature within line of sight that is attempting a save against the same effect. The target takes a penalty on its saving throw equal to 1d4 + 1 for every 4 levels you possess. You gain the value of their penalty as a luck bonus on your saving throw. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. This replaces the revelation gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Each time a cyclopean seer would gain a bonus spell from her mystery, she instead selects a divination spell from any class&#146;s spell list. If the spell is not on the cleric spell list, it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level oracle spell the cyclopean seer can cast. This ability alters the bonus spells granted by the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A cyclopean seer must choose the haunted, hunger (see above), powerless prophecy (see above), or tongues curse at 1st level.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>All cyclopean seers have access to the following revelations, regardless of their chosen mysteries.</p>
			<p><i>Doomsaying (Su): </i>As a standard action, you can pronounce doom on a creature within 30 feet. The target takes a penalty equal to your oracle level on either all skill checks, all savings throws, or all attack rolls (your choice) for 1 minute or until he fails one such roll. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. This is a curse effect (Ultimate Magic 137).</p>
			<p><i>Flash of Insight (Su): </i>You gain the cyclops racial ability of the same name (Bestiary 52). If you already possess this ability, you gain an additional daily use.</p>
			<p><i>Prescience (Ex): </i>You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against attacks of opportunity and a +2 bonus on concentration checks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the revelation class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Brutal Trance (Su): </b>Once per day as a standard action, you can enter a trance that lasts 1 round per oracle level you possess. While in this trance, you are confused, but each round that you can act normally, you can ask a single question as if using commune. This replaces the revelation gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, you embody ancient cyclopes&#146; insight. You can use each of the following once per day as a spell-like ability: discern location, prying eyes, and stone tell. In addition, using flash of insight to select a d20 roll result equal to or lower than your Charisma modifier doesn&#146;t expend that ability. This replaces the final revelation of the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The community guardian is chosen to protect and succor the weak and innocent within her community. Her calling also allows her to draw upon and focus the collective will in order to achieve those goals. A community guardian has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any good.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>bless water (2nd), consecrate (4th), remove disease (6th), hallow (10th), heroes&#146; feast (12th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells from these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A community guardian must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit of Community (Ex): </i>As a move action, you call upon the spirits of community. For the next round, you grant every ally within 30 feet a +1 competence bonus on a single skill check (of the ally&#146;s choice) that it makes before the end of this revelation&#146;s duration. Furthermore, allies within 30 feet can, as a free action, choose to forgo this bonus, and instead grant a single ally a +1 increase to its competence bonus granted by this ability (maximum +5). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Renewing Radiance (Su): </i>Once per day you can produce a burst of swirling white light that provides a measure of protection and renewal to allies within 30 feet for 1 round. On their turn, the allies can choose either to gain a +1 sacred bonus to AC for 1 round or to heal a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma bonus (their choice). If an ally is dying, it is stabilized instead. At 7th level, the bonus to AC increases to +2, and the healing increases to 2d6 + your Charisma bonus hit points, and at 14th level the bonus to AC increases to +3, and the healing increases to 3d6 + your Charisma bonus hit points. You must take this revelation at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

				<name type="string">Curse of Black Blood</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>All black-blooded oracles effectively share the same curse&#151;the curse of black blood. The material affects these oracles physically and mentally, altering both physiology and mystic powers. The blood of a black-blooded oracle actually runs black, and wounds she suffers are infected by her own power and are difficult to heal. She is immune to the effects (both beneficial and destructive) of black blood. Positive and negative energy affect a black-blooded oracle as if she were undead&#151; positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her (this aspect of the curse has no effect if the oracle is undead). The curse also dulls the oracle&#146;s coordination somewhat, imparting a &#150;4 penalty on all Dexterity-based skill checks. At 5th level, she gains cold resistance 5. This increases to cold resistance 10 at 10th level, and immunity to cold at 15th level. This ability replaces the oracle&#146;s curse.</p>

					<p>Black Blood Spray (Su): As an immediate action whenever a black-blooded oracle takes piercing or slashing damage, she can cause some of her black blood to spray from the wound to strike any adjacent target.

If she hits, she deals 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per 2 oracle levels she possesses. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1/day).</p>
					<p>Dark Resilience (Su): The black blood flowing through a black-blooded oracle&#146;s veins gives her resistance to many effects to which undead are immune. Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever she fails a saving throw against an ability drain, a death effect, disease, energy drain, paralysis, or poison, she may attempt that saving throw again with a +4 circumstance bonus. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th level, she can use this ability twice per day. At 15th level, she can use the ability 3 times per day.</p>
					<p>Darkvision (Ex): A black-blooded oracle gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The range increases to 90 feet at 15th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The black-blooded oracle has been infused with the eerie influence of strange fluids that seep from the rock in the deepest pits of the Darklands, the so-called &#147;Black Blood of Orv.&#148; Often, the eerie taint of the black blood can lie dormant in a lineage for generations before manifesting. It even seems capable of reaching out to touch those destined to become oracles through other strange methods. However an oracle becomes black-blooded, her divine powers carry within them the weird power of this chilling magical substance. A black-blooded oracle has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Black Blood Revelations: </b>All black-blooded oracles have access to the following revelations, regardless of what mystery they choose.</p>
			<p><i>Black Blood Spray (Su): </i>As an immediate action whenever a black-blooded oracle takes piercing or slashing damage, she can cause some of her black blood to spray from the wound to strike any adjacent target. She must make a touch attack to hit the target (if she&#146;s attacking the creature that caused the wound, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on her attack roll). If she hits, she deals 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per 2 oracle levels she possesses. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1/day).</p>
			<p><i>Dark Resilience (Su): </i>The black blood flowing through a black-blooded oracle&#146;s veins gives her resistance to many effects to which undead are immune. Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever she fails a saving throw against an ability drain, a death effect, disease, energy drain, paralysis, or poison, she may attempt that saving throw again with a +4 circumstance bonus. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th level, she can use this ability twice per day. At 15th level, she can use the ability 3 times per day.</p>
			<p><i>Darkvision (Ex): </i>A black-blooded oracle gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The range increases to 90 feet at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Curse of Black Blood (Su): </b>All black-blooded oracles effectively share the same curse&#151;the curse of black blood. The material affects these oracles physically and mentally, altering both physiology and mystic powers. The blood of a black-blooded oracle actually runs black, and wounds she suffers are infected by her own power and are difficult to heal. She is immune to the effects (both beneficial and destructive) of black blood. Positive and negative energy affect a black-blooded oracle as if she were undead&#151; positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her (this aspect of the curse has no effect if the oracle is undead). The curse also dulls the oracle&#146;s coordination somewhat, imparting a &#150;4 penalty on all Dexterity-based skill checks. At 5th level, she gains cold resistance 5. This increases to cold resistance 10 at 10th level, and immunity to cold at 15th level. This ability replaces the oracle&#146;s curse.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The ancient lorekeeper is a repository for all the beliefs and vast knowledge of an elven people. She shows a strong interest in and understanding of histories and creation legends at a young age, and as she matures her calling to serve as the memory of her long-lived people becomes clear to all who know her. An ancient lorekeeper has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Elf Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcane) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Class Skills: </b>An ancient lorekeeper adds Knowledge (arcane) and Knowledge (local) to her list of class skills. Whenever she makes a Knowledge check of any kind about a question regarding elves (creatures of the elf subtype), the ancient lorekeeper adds half her class level on her check. This replaces the bonus skills the ancient lorekeeper gains from her mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Elven Arcana (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an ancient lorekeeper&#146;s mastery of elven legends and philosophy has allowed her to master one spell used by elven wizards. She selects one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least one level lower than the highest-level oracle spell she can cast. The ancient lorekeeper gains this as a bonus spell known. The spell is treated as one level higher than its true level for all purposes. The ancient lorekeeper may choose an additional spell at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels. This ability replaces the bonus spells she would normally gain at these levels from her chosen mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A psychic searcher is devoted to revealing the hidden within the world around her by sensing and communing with residual mental energy, haunts, and fragments of living spirits that can dwell in objects or rooms.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Augury (4th), locate object (6th), divination (8th), find the path (12th), discern location (16th), foresight (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s normal mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiration (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, a psychic searcher gains an inspiration pool, as the investigator class ability. A psychic searcher uses her oracle level as her investigator level to determine the effects of this ability. She gains free uses of inspiration on Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana, history, local, nobility, planes, religion), and Sense Motive skill checks without spending a use of inspiration, provided she&#146;s trained in that skill. A psychic searcher&#146;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, usually when she refreshes her spells. A psychic searcher&#146;s inspiration pool is based on her Charisma modifier, not her Intelligence modifier. This ability replaces the mystery spell gained at 2nd level.</p>
			<p><b>Psychic Talent (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a psychic searcher&#146;s mastery of her supernatural insight grows, granting her a new investigator talent from the following list: amazing inspiration, eidetic recollection, empathy, inspired alertness, item lore, perceptive tracking (except using Sense Motive instead of Perception or Survival), rogue talent (only for hard to foolAPG), and tenacious inspiration. Whenever a psychic searcher can select a new revelation, she can instead select an investigator or rogue talent from the above list. This ability replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some oracles are possessed by spirits, demons, or similar beings. Instead of the possessed oracle drawing her powers from deities, these otherworldly forces work their magic through her.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>ventriloquism (2nd), spider climb (4th), screech (6th), sleepwalk (8th), telekinesis (10th), animate objects (12th), divine vessel (16th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s normal mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A possessed oracle must choose the haunted or tongues curse at 1st level.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A possessed oracle must take the following revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Two Minds (Su): </i>You gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells or effects. At 7th level, you may reroll a failed Will save once per day as an immediate action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>-</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>At 1st level, a warsighted can use a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The warsighted must otherwise meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her oracle level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A warsighted&#146;s unique gifts are not in strange magical revelations, but in her ability to adapt in the midst of a battle with new fighting techniques. The warsighted is a master of combat, as dedicated as a fighter and as flexible as a brawler.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Martial Flexibility (Ex): </b>At 1st level, a warsighted can use a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn&#146;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The warsighted must otherwise meet all the feat&#146;s prerequisites. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her oracle level.</p>
			<p>The warsighted can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice.</p>
			<p>If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (for example, Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#146;s daily limit. At later levels, when she gains multiple feats through this ability, she can use those feats to meet the prerequisites of other feats she gains with this ability. Doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#146;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.</p>
			<p>At 7th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action.</p>
			<p>At 11th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefits of three combat feats at the same time. She can select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action.</p>
			<p>At 15th level, a warsighted can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the revelations gained at 1st, 7th, 11th, and 15th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Tree souls develop an affinity not just with trees but also with objects carved from them, feeling the essence of the tree&#146;s spirit living within. By bonding to trees, they learn to manipulate the trees&#146; power to produce divine energy. The type of tree a tree soul oracle bonds to often seems to influence the oracle&#146;s personality. A tree soul who is bound to a towering redwood may value traditions and be slow to anger, while a tree soul bound to a smaller pine tree might be quick to react and have a somewhat prickly personality. Regardless of the trees they form their metaphysical attachment to, tree soul oracles tend to be steadfast and stubborn, having an aura of timelessness even as the world changes around them.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Tree souls are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor. A tree soul can also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Tree souls are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but can use only those crafted from wood.</p>
			<p>A tree soul who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast oracle spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A tree soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Transform Wood (Su): </i><b>At 1st level, as a standard action you can temporarily transform a number of 5-foot cubes of wood each day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. The wood takes on the quality of darkwood for 1 minute per oracle level. At 11th level, you can have it instead take on the quality of living steel for the same duration.</b></p>
			<p><i>Living Steel Dolls (Ex): </i>At 11th level, you add animate objects to your list of spells known. When you cast this spell on wooden objects, the objects&#146; wooden parts immediately transform into living steel. If the objects are destroyed or the duration ends, the wooden parts revert back to their original material.</p>
			<p><b>Tree Bound Curse (Su): </b>You bind your power to a specific tree. Any damage to the tree deals the same amount of damage to you, overcoming DR, energy resistance, and immunities. Damage you take in this way cannot be healed by normal or magical means until your bonded tree is healed or destroyed. The damage can reduce you to 0 hit points but not below. If the tree is destroyed, you are considered to be staggered and are unable to cast oracle spells or use supernatural or spell-like class abilities until you bond with a new tree in a ceremony that takes 12 hours to complete. Once per month, you can create a new bond with a different tree in a ceremony at that tree that takes 12 hours to complete. You lose your bond with your previous tree in the process.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Warp wood (2nd), tree stride (10th), ironwood (12th), changestaff (14th), repel metal or stone (16th), greater siege of trees (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Tree Soul Revelation (Su): </b>At 20th level, your skin takes on the appearance and properties of a tree trunk. This bark-like skin grants you a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and DR 10/slashing. You also regrow any severed limbs except your head within 24 hours as per regenerate. Finally, once a day as a standard action, you can assume the form of a treant, as per plant shape III, for a number of minutes equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Some oracles seek meaning in the pattern of the stars across the night sky, the trails of comets, and the eternal orbits of the planets.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>faerie fire (2nd), glitterdust (4th), guiding star (6th), wandering star motes (8th), meteor swarm (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A stargazer must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Guiding Star (Su): </i>As the heavens mystery revelation. You must take this revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Star Chart (Ex): </i>As the heavens mystery revelation. You must take this revelation at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Through her exploration of the universe&#146;s mysteries, a spirit guide opens connections to the spirit world and forms bonds with the entities that inhabit it.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Bonded Spirit (Su): </b>At 3rd level, a spirit guide can form a temporary bond with a spirit, as the shaman&#146;s wandering spirit class feature (see page 37). She must make this selection each day when she refreshes her spells. A spirit guide cannot bond with a spirit that is incompatible with her alignment, ethos, or mystery (GM&#146;s discretion).</p>
			<p>A spirit guide gains one hex of her choice from the list of hexes available from that spirit. She uses her oracle level as her shaman level, and she switches Wisdom for Charisma and vice versa for the purpose of determining the hex's effects.</p>
			<p>At 4th level, she adds the bonded spirit&#146;s spirit magic spells to her oracle spells known for that day, but only of spell levels she can cast. At 7th level, she gains the spirit ability of her current bonded spirit. At 15th level, she gains the greater spirit ability of her current bonded spirit.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the revelations gained at 3rd, 7th, and 15th levels.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>At 7th level, a shigenjo gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the shigenjo&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/3 her oracle level + her Charisma modifier. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the shigenjo possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ki points gained from the shigenjo class stack with those gained from the other class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is permanent. The shigenjo can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
					<p>As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, a shigenjo can make a ki strike as a monk whose level is equal to her oracle level &#150; 3. As a swift action, she may spend 1 point of ki to gain one of the following benefits.</p>
					<p>Ki Magic: Add +1 to the DC of the next spell she casts on her turn.</p>
					<p>Ki Curse: Treat her oracle level as 5 higher for the purpose of determining the effects of her curse for the next round.</p>
					<p>Ki Insight: Gain a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks for 1 round.</p>

			<p><i>The shigenjo walks the path of enlightenment and transcendence by seeking oneness with the celestial spirits. In doing so, she unlocks the martial potential of her own spiritual power. A shigenjo has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any neutral.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Tengu Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>true strike (2nd), alter self (4th), divine power (8th), magic jar (12th), ki shout (14th, ), moment of prescience (16th). These bonus spells replace the shigenjo&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Ki Pool (Su): </b>At 7th level, a shigenjo gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the shigenjo&#146;s ki pool is equal to 1/3 her oracle level + her Charisma modifier. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the shigenjo possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ki points gained from the shigenjo class stack with those gained from the other class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is permanent. The shigenjo can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.</p>
			<p>As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, a shigenjo can make a ki strike as a monk whose level is equal to her oracle level &#150; 3. As a swift action, she may spend 1 point of ki to gain one of the following benefits.</p>
			<p>Ki Magic: Add +1 to the DC of the next spell she casts on her turn.</p>
			<p>Ki Curse: Treat her oracle level as 5 higher for the purpose of determining the effects of her curse for the next round.</p>
			<p>Ki Insight: Gain a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks for 1 round.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the shigenjo&#146;s 7th-level revelation.</p>
			<p><b>Quivering Palm (Su): </b>At 15th level, a shigenjo may learn quivering palm as the monk ability of the same name in place of a revelation. She treats her oracle level as her monk level for this ability, and the DC is based on her Charisma bonus instead of her Wisdom bonus.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, you achieve true enlightenment and becomes one with the celestial spirits. You gain the ability to speak with any creature that uses a language. For a number of days equal to your Wisdom score, you can ignore the negative effects of extreme weather, starvation, thirst, and exhaustion. If you die, your powerful connection to the celestial realm allows you to be reborn 3 days later (as reincarnate). This replaces the final revelation of the shigenjo&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>While all oracles possess some ability at divination, the seer is a true prophet, able to see things as they really are, or will be.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>detect thoughts (4th), clairaudience/clairvoyance (6th), scrying (8th), true seeing (10th), legend lore (12th), greater scrying (14th), vision (16th), foresight (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A seer must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Natural Divination (Ex): </i>As the nature mystery revelation. You must take this revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Gift of Prophecy (Su): </i>Once per day, you can enter a trance to gain a glimpse of the future. This trance lasts for 1 minute, which must be uninterrupted and during which you can take no other actions. At 3rd level, you gain the benefits of an augury spell with 90% effectiveness. At 5th level, you gain the benefits of a divination spell with 90% effectiveness. At 9th level, the knowledge you gain is equivalent to a commune spell. None of these spell effects require material components. You must take this revelation at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical items in order to learn more about their oracle mysteries or sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and weird, a seeker gains Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1).

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Oracles and sorcerers gain their magical powers through strange and mysterious ways, be they chosen by fate or blood. While most might be content with their strange powers, some oracles and sorcerers join the Pathfinders specifically to find out more about their mysteries and bloodlines and determine the genesis and history of their eldritch talents. These spellcasters are known among the Spells as seekers, after their obsession with researching ancient texts and obscure ruins for any clues they can find about their heritage and histories. A seeker has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Tinkering (Ex): </b>Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical items in order to learn more about their oracle mysteries or sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and weird, a seeker gains Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also possesses levels in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels stack with his oracle or sorcerer levels for determining his overall bonus on these skill checks. For an oracle, this ability replaces all of the bonus class skills he would otherwise normally gain from his mystery. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces his bonus Eschew Materials feat.</p>
			<p><b>Seeker Lore (Ex): </b>By 3rd level, a seeker has already learned much about his mystery or bloodline, and is more comfortable using the bonus spells gained by that mystery or bloodline. He gains a +4 bonus on all concentration checks, on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance, and on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks made on topics associated with his bonus spells. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Seeker Magic (Su): </b>At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his mystery or bloodline spells with metamagic.

For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>River soul oracles derive their powers from their bonds with rivers, whether these waterways are rapid cascades or lazy channels plied by boats. The powerful bond formed with a river is also the river soul oracle&#146;s curse, as he must always carry water from the river with him, and his fate is bound to it. River soul oracles can be gentle and still when calm, but they&#146;re raging torrents when angered.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A river soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>River Flow (Su): </i>At 1st level, as a free action while you are underwater, you can negate the penalties you take for making bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing melee attacks underwater. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The rounds do not have to be used consecutively. River Form (Su): At 11th level, you can become one with a river. Once a day as a standard action, while immersed in a river, you can completely merge with it. Your body and all your gear meld into the water, as per meld into stone, except abilities that control or shape water expel you and deal you 5d6 damage rather than abilities that control or shape stone. You travel along with the river at the rate it is currently moving. You can remain in this form a number of hours equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Transforming back to your normal form is a swift action.</p>
			<p><b>River Soul Revelation (Su): </b>At 20th level, you strengthen your ties to the river with which you bonded. While traveling on or immersed in the river, you gain fast healing 10 and immunity to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Additionally, if you are slain and your body or some part of your body (including your ashes, if applicable) is floated down the river in a specially prepared vessel costing 5,000 gp, you return to life as per resurrection once you reach the mouth of the river, as long as the trip has taken 24 hours or longer..</p>

					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A reincarnated oracle draws her knowledge and power from the experiences of her previous lives. Her memories guide her through a spiritual ascension leading the way to her ultimate incarnation. A reincarnated oracle has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Samsaran Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>see alignment (2nd), detect thoughts (4th), contact other plane (10th), moment of prescience (16th), overwhelming presence (18th). These spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A reincarnated oracle must choose the haunted or tongues curse at 1st level.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A reincarnated oracle must take the following revelations at one of the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Location Memories (Su): </i>As a swift action, you may search your past lives for memories of or insight about your current location. This grants you the scent ability, low-light vision, and a +2 insight bonus on Perception and Survival checks for 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st level or 3rd level.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit Memories (Su): </i>Once per day, you call upon the unfulfilled desires and goals of your past lives and project their frustration and despair through your eyes at a target. This is a gaze attack affecting one creature. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier) or be sickened and staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st, 3rd, or 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The purifier seeks out signs of possession or mind control that manifest from unwilling (and often unwitting) servants for fiendish corruptors and their mortal minions. A purifier seeks liberation of mind, body, and spirit from the bondage of sin and the taint of the unholy. A purifier gains the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Aasimar Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>veil of heaven (2nd), confess (4th), cast out (6th), denounce (8th), dispel evil (10th), banishment (12th), holy word (14th), mind blank (16th), freedom (18th).</p>
			<p><b>Diminished Spellcasting: </b>A purifier can use one fewer spell per day of each level and does not automatically learn cure or inflict spells. Her number of oracle spells known is unchanged.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A purifier must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>See Sin (Sp): </i>At 3rd level, a purifier gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her oracle level on Sense Motive checks to sense enchantments, which she can make as a full-round action. She also gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her oracle level on Spellcraft checks to identify enchantment school spells and spells with the curse or emotion descriptor (see page 251 of for spells in the and that have the curse or emotion descriptor).</p>
			<p><i>Celestial Armor (Su): </i>At 7th level, a purifier&#146;s armor takes on a golden or silvery sheen and becomes light as a feather. Her armor weighs half as much as long as she wears it, and she also gains armor training as a fighter 4 levels lower than her oracle level. At 11th level, a purifier gains heavy armor proficiency.</p>
			<p><i>Sin Eater (Su): </i>At 11th level, a purifier can consume a curse, enchantment, or emotion effect by touch as a full-round action. She can do this a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier, and must make a Charisma check with a bonus equal to her oracle level against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect (or the Hit Dice of the creator for a supernatural effect). If the check succeeds, the effect is negated; however, the purifier is sickened for 1d4 rounds.</p>
			<p>If the target is possessed (such as by a magic jar effect or a ghost&#146;s malevolence ability), the possessor is forced out on a successful check. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the possessor is sickened for 2d4 rounds.</p>
			<p><b>Sacred Scourge (Su): </b>At 5th level, a purifier may channel holy power to harm evil outsiders as a cleric of her level using the Alignment Channel feat. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p><b>Holy Terror (Su): </b>At 9th level, a purifier may use her sacred scourge to panic evil outsiders as if using the Turn Undead feat against undead.</p>
			<p><b>Celestial Master (Su): </b>At 13th level, a purifier may use her sacred scourge to compel good outsiders to serve her, as if using the Command Undead feat against undead.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A planar oracle has an affinity with one of the Outer Planes. She is at home on the multiple planes of the Great Beyond, and can eventually become an outsider herself.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>endure elements (2nd), elemental speech (4th), tongues (6th), planar adaptation (8th), plane shift (10th), mass planar adaptation (12th), shadow walk (14th), etherealness (16th), gate (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, you must choose one Outer Plane with which you have an affinity. This choice cannot be changed. A planar oracle must take the following revelation at 3rd level.</p>
			<p>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, you become an extraplanar creature. Choose one outer plane, such as Heaven or the Abyss. You gain superficial physical characteristics as appropriate to natives of your chosen outer plane. For example, if your chosen plane is Heaven, you gain angelic features such as a halo and metallic skin. This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Your type changes to &#147;outsider (extraplanar),&#148; except on your associated plane, where your type is &#147;outsider (native).&#148; In addition, you gain immunity to your associated energy type and gain damage reduction 10/magic. Unlike other outsiders, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type. This replaces the final revelation of the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>In distant Tian Xia, herbalists practice an obscure alchemical art known as Pei Zin herbalism, which involves medicinal and restorative techniques that are used throughout much of that continent. A few practitioners develop a talent for Pei Zin that transcends ordinary alchemy, allowing them to blur the line between applying alchemical medicine and coaxing divine miracles.</i></p>
			<p><i>Like other masters of the art, Pei Zin practitioners can use the Profession (herbalist) skill in place of Craft (alchemy) to create alchemical remedies with recipes that include certain plant-derived reagents. More information is on pages 24&#150;25 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Healer&#146;s Way (Su): </b>A Pei Zin practitioner combines alchemy, acupuncture, and divine magic to heal wounds by touch. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, she uses positive energy to heal the target of 1d6 hit points for every 2 oracle levels she has. Using this ability is a standard action unless the oracle targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Using this ability requires only one free hand. This ability counts as a paladin&#146;s lay on hands ability for the purposes of feats, spells, and effects that work with that class feature when it is used for healing purposes. Unlike lay on hands, this ability cannot be used to harm undead.</p>
			<p><b>Master Herbalist (Su): </b>A Pei Zin practitioner has mastered countless alchemical techniques that supplement her divine powers and greatly aid her when she heals the sick and wounded. She gains a competence bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1), and uses her Charisma modifier in place of her Wisdom modifier when attempting Profession (herbalist) checks. Additionally, a Pei Zin practitioner can identify potions as if via detect magic using Profession (herbalist) instead of Spellcraft, and she can attempt such a check after holding a potion for 1 round.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Master Healing Technique (Su): </b>At 7th level, whenever a Pei Zin practitioner heals a living creature with her healer&#146;s way ability, as a free action she can attempt a Profession (herbalist) check to remove a condition from the target, with each condition having an accompanying Profession (herbalist) DC (see the list below). She cannot take 10 or 20 on this check, nor can she receive aid from any creature except another Pei Zin practitioner (though the practitioner need not be an oracle; see pages 24&#150;25 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual). Failure by 5 or more causes the target to become sickened for 1 round (if the Pei Zin practitioner is attempting to remove the sickened condition, this extends it by 1 round). Similarly, failure by 10 or more instead causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round or to have its existing nauseated condition extended by 1 round. A creature that cannot be sickened or nauseated cannot have conditions removed by this ability.</p>
			<p><i>Minor Conditions (DC 20): </i>Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.</p>
			<p><i>Major Conditions (DC 25): </i>Dazed and staggered.</p>
			<p><i>Severe Conditions (DC 30): </i>Confused, exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.</p>
			<p><i>Dire Conditions (DC 35): </i>Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the revelation gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Although many merfolk claim deep connections to both art and the natural world, a rare few merfolk can manipulate the forces of nature and weave them into song. An ocean&#146;s echo is a merfolk gifted with the powers of an oracle and a singing voice that evokes the legendary tales of merfolk virtuosos.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Sound burst (4th), shout (8th), song of discord (10th), greater shout (12th), and pied pipingAPG (14th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Inspiring Song (Ex): </b>The voice of an ocean&#146;s echo provides inspiration to allies. This ability is identical to bardic performance (using Perform [sing] only), allowing her to inspire courage at 1st level, inspire competence at 3rd level, and inspire heroics at 15th level, as a bard of the ocean&#146;s echo&#146;s level. It is usable a total number of rounds per day equal to her level + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>
			<p>This ability replaces the revelations gained at 1st, 3rd, and 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>Keleshite prophets help guide and serve the vast Padishah Empire of Kelesh and its interests across Golarion.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (dance) (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>A Keleshite prophet gains the following bonus spells: clairaudience/clairvoyance (6th), prying eyes (10th), true seeing (12th), prediction of failureUM (16th), foresight (18th).</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A Keleshite prophet must take the following revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Divining Dance (Su) </i>Once per day, you can perform a sacred meditative dance that gives you great clarity of mind and prepares you for what lies ahead. This dance must last for at least 1 minute, uninterrupted, and you can take no other actions during the dance.</p>
			<p>When you dance, attempt a Perform (dance) check; the results of the check determine the benefits you gain for the next 24 hours, as listed below. You can always choose the benefit from a lower result, if you wish (for example, if your Perform [dance] result is 15, you can choose to gain a +1 bonus on your divinations&#146; saving throws instead of choosing to use augury once as a spell-like ability).</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An inerrant voice serves as a spiritual advisor to either a monarch or noble. Most Qadiran nobles retain one&#146;s services, for both guidance and protection.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>An inerrant voice gains the following bonus spells: shield other (2nd), augury (4th), divination (8th), vision (14th).</p>
			<p>These replace the bonus spells at those levels gained from the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>An inerrant voice must take the following revelation at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><i>Vigilant Protector (Su): </i>Each day when you recover your spells, you can select a specific person you know other than yourself as your ward. When your ward becomes the target of an attack or spell and you are aware of the attack, you can cast an abjuration spell you know on the ally as an immediate action. You must expend the appropriate spell slot and be able to target the ally as normal for the spell. At 11th level, as an immediate action when you know your ward is targeted, you can transpose yourself with your ward, teleporting into the original target&#146;s square (and becoming the new target of the attack or spell) while your ally is teleported into yours; this is a teleportation effect that doesn&#146;t provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use this revelation once per day, plus an additional time at 7th level and every 4 oracle levels thereafter.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A hermit is a recluse who gained her oracular powers from isolation in a deep desert, on a mountain peak, or in another secluded location. A connection to untraveled places gives the hermit powers to evade his enemies.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Blindness/deafness (4th), crushing despair (8th), wall of force (12th), maze (16th).</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>A hermit must choose a mystery that adds Survival to his list of class skills, such as nature or stone.</p>
			<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A hermit must choose the reclusive curse (below) at 1st level.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A hermit must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Recluse&#146;s Stride (Su): </i>Your base speed increases by 10 feet. At 5th level, once per round when leaving a square, you can treat the square as though it isn&#146;t threatened by any opponents that you can see. At 10th level, you can teleport a distance equal to your base land speed (as per dimension door) as a move action, provided that there are no other creatures within 10 feet of you when you use this ability and no other creatures within 10 feet of your destination. You can teleport a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Fade from Memory (Su) </i>At 7th level, whenever there are no creatures within 10 feet of you at the end of your turn, you gain 20% concealment until the beginning of your next turn as a free action. At 14th level, you instead gain 50% concealment until the beginning of your next turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your oracle level. You must take this revelation at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The enlightened philosopher seeks enlightenment through compassion, moderation, and humility. By following her philosophy&#146;s teachings, the enlightened philosopher seeks to reach enlightenment and become one with the universe.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any lawful.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>owl&#146;s wisdom (4th), water walk (6th), discern lies (8th), true seeing (10th), wind walk (12th), ethereal jaunt (14th), moment of prescience (16th), astral projection (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>An enlightened philosopher must take the following revelation at 7th level.</p>
			<p><i>Mental Acuity (Ex): </i>As the lore mystery revelation.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>Upon achieving 20th level, you achieve true enlightenment and become one with the universe. You receive a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier. You become immune to confusion, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, and sickened effects. You can take 20 on all Knowledge skill checks. Should you die, you are reborn 3 days later as a living example of the summoning of your chosen philosophy (treat as the reincarnate spell). This replaces the final revelation of the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>An elementalist oracle shares an affinity with the elements and elemental creatures. She can communicate with elemental creatures and can eventually become an elemental herself. She sees perfection in manifestations of elemental fury in the natural world, be they the thunderous wrath of the storm, the churning waters of the ocean&#146;s tides or a flooding river, the terrain-shaping power of a landslide or earthquake, or the apocalyptic fury of a volcanic eruption.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Elemental touch (4th), protection from energy (6th), elemental body I (8th), summon monster V (elementals only; 10th), elemental body III (12th), elemental swarm (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>An elementalist oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Elemental Linguist (Su): </i>At 1st level, you gain a bonus language of your choice from the following list: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran. At 5th, 10th, and 15th levels, you gain another language chosen from this list.</p>
			<p><i>Elemental Form (Su): </i>At 11th level, you gain the air, earth, fire, or water subtype and an associated ability:</p>
			<list>
				<li>Air: Fly speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability.</li>
				<li>Earth: Tremorsense with a range of 30 feet.</li>
				<li>Fire: Immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold.</li>
				<li>Water: Swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe underwater.</li>
			</list>
			<p><b>Elemental Revelation (Su): </b>At 20th level, you fully harness the power of the elements. You can apply the Elemental Spell metamagic feat to spells you cast without increasing the level or casting time. You can choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire each time you use this ability. Whenever you score a critical hit with an attack that deals energy damage, you ignore the target&#146;s energy resistance (if any). If you score such a critical hit against a creature that has immunity to the energy type you are attacking with, the creature takes half damage from the attack.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>All oracles are cursed to some degree, but some oracles bear an even heavier burden. Though doubly afflicted with supernatural or physical hindrances, a dual-cursed oracle can manipulate fortune and gains greater insights into her mystery.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). A dual-cursed oracle gains no additional class skills from her mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>ill omen (2nd), oracle&#146;s burden (4th), bestow curse (6th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&#146;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A dual-cursed oracle must choose two curses at 1st level. One of these curses (oracle&#146;s choice) never changes its abilities as the oracle gains levels; for example, an oracle with clouded vision never gains darkvision 60 feet, blindsense, or blindsight. The other curse comes with its normal benefits.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A dual-cursed oracle gains a new revelation at 5th level and 13th level. These are in addition to the normal revelations she receives at 3rd level, 7th level, and so on. In addition, the cursed oracle may select the following revelations in place of a mystery revelation.</p>
			<p><i>Misfortune (Ex): </i>At 1st level, as an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 feet to reroll any one d20 roll that it has just made before the results of the roll are revealed. The creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it&#146;s worse than the original roll. Once a creature has suffered from your misfortune, it cannot be the target of this revelation again for 1 day.</p>
			<p><i>Fortune (Ex): </i>At 5th level, as an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll that you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it&#146;s worse than the original roll. You can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every six oracle levels beyond 5th.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>At 7th level, the divine numerologist&#146;s mastery of the divine mathematics allows her to set specific parameters in the divine equation to adjust the outcome of an event right as it is about to occur.

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The Oracular Council of Po Li and those trained in their sacred methods often include divine numerologists, who use esoteric mathematics and numbers traditions to peer into the past and future and extract meaningful portents. The divine numerologist&#146;s ultimate goal is to learn and understand the patterns in the equations and algorithms that underscore even the most chaotic forms of reality and use them to their personal advantage.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Prying eyes (10th), numerological evocation (12th), greater arcane sight (14th), moment of prescience (16th), foresight (18th).</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, a divine numerologist understands the math behind the entirety of existence well enough to significantly tweak her own personal fate. The divine numerologist ceases aging. She no longer suffers age-related penalties to ability scores and cannot be magically aged. Additionally, once per day when the divine numerologist or another allied creature within 30 feet of her threatens a critical hit, the critical hit is automatically confirmed.</p>

For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>A cyclopean seer draws power from the mysterious prophetic abilities of ancient giants.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Assume Fate (Su): </b>As an immediate action when targeted by an effect that requires a saving throw, you can choose another creature within line of sight that is attempting a save against the same effect. The target takes a penalty on its saving throw equal to 1d4 + 1 for every 4 levels you possess. You gain the value of their penalty as a luck bonus on your saving throw. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. This replaces the revelation gained at 1st level.</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Each time a cyclopean seer would gain a bonus spell from her mystery, she instead selects a divination spell from any class&#146;s spell list. If the spell is not on the cleric spell list, it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level oracle spell the cyclopean seer can cast. This ability alters the bonus spells granted by the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>A cyclopean seer must choose the haunted, hunger (see above), powerless prophecy (see above), or tongues curse at 1st level.</p>
			<p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>All cyclopean seers have access to the following revelations, regardless of their chosen mysteries.</p>
			<p><i>Doomsaying (Su): </i>As a standard action, you can pronounce doom on a creature within 30 feet. The target takes a penalty equal to your oracle level on either all skill checks, all savings throws, or all attack rolls (your choice) for 1 minute or until he fails one such roll. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. This is a curse effect (Ultimate Magic 137).</p>
			<p><i>Flash of Insight (Su): </i>You gain the cyclops racial ability of the same name (Bestiary 52). If you already possess this ability, you gain an additional daily use.</p>
			<p><i>Prescience (Ex): </i>You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against attacks of opportunity and a +2 bonus on concentration checks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1.</p>
			<p>This ability alters the revelation class feature.</p>
			<p><b>Brutal Trance (Su): </b>Once per day as a standard action, you can enter a trance that lasts 1 round per oracle level you possess. While in this trance, you are confused, but each round that you can act normally, you can ask a single question as if using commune. This replaces the revelation gained at 7th level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, you embody ancient cyclopes&#146; insight. You can use each of the following once per day as a spell-like ability: discern location, prying eyes, and stone tell. In addition, using flash of insight to select a d20 roll result equal to or lower than your Charisma modifier doesn&#146;t expend that ability. This replaces the final revelation of the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The community guardian is chosen to protect and succor the weak and innocent within her community. Her calling also allows her to draw upon and focus the collective will in order to achieve those goals. A community guardian has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any good.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent.

			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p>A community guardian must take the following revelations at the listed levels.</p>
			<p><i>Spirit of Community (Ex): </i>As a move action, you call upon the spirits of community. For the next round, you grant every ally within 30 feet a +1 competence bonus on a single skill check (of the ally&#146;s choice) that it makes before the end of this revelation&#146;s duration. Furthermore, allies within 30 feet can, as a free action, choose to forgo this bonus, and instead grant a single ally a +1 increase to its competence bonus granted by this ability (maximum +5). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st level.</p>
			<p><i>Renewing Radiance (Su): </i>Once per day you can produce a burst of swirling white light that provides a measure of protection and renewal to allies within 30 feet for 1 round. On their turn, the allies can choose either to gain a +1 sacred bonus to AC for 1 round or to heal a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma bonus (their choice). If an ally is dying, it is stabilized instead. At 7th level, the bonus to AC increases to +2, and the healing increases to 2d6 + your Charisma bonus hit points, and at 14th level the bonus to AC increases to +3, and the healing increases to 3d6 + your Charisma bonus hit points. You must take this revelation at 3rd level.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

					<p>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
					<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
					<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
					<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
					<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>

				<name type="string">Mystery</name>
				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
					<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>

				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>All black-blooded oracles effectively share the same curse&#151;the curse of black blood. The material affects these oracles physically and mentally, altering both physiology and mystic powers. The blood of a black-blooded oracle actually runs black, and wounds she suffers are infected by her own power and are difficult to heal. She is immune to the effects (both beneficial and destructive) of black blood. Positive and negative energy affect a black-blooded oracle as if she were undead&#151; positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her (this aspect of the curse has no effect if the oracle is undead). The curse also dulls the oracle&#146;s coordination somewhat, imparting a &#150;4 penalty on all Dexterity-based skill checks. At 5th level, she gains cold resistance 5. This increases to cold resistance 10 at 10th level, and immunity to cold at 15th level. This ability replaces the oracle&#146;s curse.</p>

					<p>All black-blooded oracles have access to the following revelations, regardless of what mystery they choose.</p>
					<p>Black Blood Spray (Su): As an immediate action whenever a black-blooded oracle takes piercing or slashing damage, she can cause some of her black blood to spray from the wound to strike any adjacent target. She must make a touch attack to hit the target (if she&#146;s attacking the creature that caused the wound, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on her attack roll). If she hits, she deals 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per 2 oracle levels she possesses. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1/day).</p>
					<p>Dark Resilience (Su): The black blood flowing through a black-blooded oracle&#146;s veins gives her resistance to many effects to which undead are immune. Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever she fails a saving throw against an ability drain, a death effect, disease, energy drain, paralysis, or poison, she may attempt that saving throw again with a +4 circumstance bonus. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th level, she can use this ability twice per day. At 15th level, she can use the ability 3 times per day.</p>
					<p>Darkvision (Ex): A black-blooded oracle gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The range increases to 90 feet at 15th level.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The black-blooded oracle has been infused with the eerie influence of strange fluids that seep from the rock in the deepest pits of the Darklands, the so-called &#147;Black Blood of Orv.&#148; Often, the eerie taint of the black blood can lie dormant in a lineage for generations before manifesting. It even seems capable of reaching out to touch those destined to become oracles through other strange methods. However an oracle becomes black-blooded, her divine powers carry within them the weird power of this chilling magical substance. A black-blooded oracle has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). In addition, oracles receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Black Blood Revelations: </b>All black-blooded oracles have access to the following revelations, regardless of what mystery they choose.</p>
			<p><i>Black Blood Spray (Su): </i>As an immediate action whenever a black-blooded oracle takes piercing or slashing damage, she can cause some of her black blood to spray from the wound to strike any adjacent target. She must make a touch attack to hit the target (if she&#146;s attacking the creature that caused the wound, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on her attack roll). If she hits, she deals 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per 2 oracle levels she possesses. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1/day).</p>
			<p><i>Dark Resilience (Su): </i>The black blood flowing through a black-blooded oracle&#146;s veins gives her resistance to many effects to which undead are immune. Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever she fails a saving throw against an ability drain, a death effect, disease, energy drain, paralysis, or poison, she may attempt that saving throw again with a +4 circumstance bonus. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th level, she can use this ability twice per day. At 15th level, she can use the ability 3 times per day.</p>
			<p><i>Darkvision (Ex): </i>A black-blooded oracle gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The range increases to 90 feet at 15th level.</p>
			<p><b>Curse of Black Blood (Su): </b>All black-blooded oracles effectively share the same curse&#151;the curse of black blood. The material affects these oracles physically and mentally, altering both physiology and mystic powers. The blood of a black-blooded oracle actually runs black, and wounds she suffers are infected by her own power and are difficult to heal. She is immune to the effects (both beneficial and destructive) of black blood. Positive and negative energy affect a black-blooded oracle as if she were undead&#151; positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her (this aspect of the curse has no effect if the oracle is undead). The curse also dulls the oracle&#146;s coordination somewhat, imparting a &#150;4 penalty on all Dexterity-based skill checks. At 5th level, she gains cold resistance 5. This increases to cold resistance 10 at 10th level, and immunity to cold at 15th level. This ability replaces the oracle&#146;s curse.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>

			<h>Summary</h>
			<p><i>The ancient lorekeeper is a repository for all the beliefs and vast knowledge of an elven people. She shows a strong interest in and understanding of histories and creation legends at a young age, and as she matures her calling to serve as the memory of her long-lived people becomes clear to all who know her. An ancient lorekeeper has the following class features.</i></p>
			<h>Description</h>
			<p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
			<p><b>Role: </b>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
			<p><b>Alignment: </b>Any.</p>
			<p><b>Hit Die: </b>d8.</p>
			<p><b>Race: </b>Elf Only</p>
			<p><b>Starting Wealth: </b>3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>
			<h>Class Skills</h>
			<p>The Oracle's class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcane) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).</p>
			<p><b>Skill Points at each Level: </b>4 + Int modifier.</p>

			<h>Class Features</h>
			<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Oracles are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Some oracle revelations grant additional proficiencies.</p>
			<p><b>Spells: </b>An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the cleric spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle&#146;s spell is 10 + the spell&#146;s level + the oracle&#146;s Charisma modifier.</p>
			<p>Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 2&#150;5. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1&#150;3 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>
			<p>Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle&#146;s selection of spells is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&#150;6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2&#150;6 are fixed.</p>
			<p>In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels, each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include all spells with &#147;cure&#148; in the name, inflict spells include all spells with &#147;inflict&#148; in the name). These spells are added as soon as the oracle is capable of casting them. This choice is made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell&#146;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any spells gained from her mystery.</p>
			<p>Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.</p>
			<p><b>Class Skills: </b>An ancient lorekeeper adds Knowledge (arcane) and Knowledge (local) to her list of class skills. Whenever she makes a Knowledge check of any kind about a question regarding elves (creatures of the elf subtype), the ancient lorekeeper adds half her class level on her check. This replaces the bonus skills the ancient lorekeeper gains from her mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Elven Arcana (Ex): </b>At 2nd level, an ancient lorekeeper&#146;s mastery of elven legends and philosophy has allowed her to master one spell used by elven wizards. She selects one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least one level lower than the highest-level oracle spell she can cast. The ancient lorekeeper gains this as a bonus spell known. The spell is treated as one level higher than its true level for all purposes. The ancient lorekeeper may choose an additional spell at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 18th levels. This ability replaces the bonus spells she would normally gain at these levels from her chosen mystery.</p>
			<p><b>Mystery: </b>Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 2&#150;6. They cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>
			<p><b>Oracle&#146;s Curse (Ex): </b>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle&#146;s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An oracle&#146;s curse is based on her oracle level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle must a single curse. All curses can be found here.</p>
			<p><b>Orisons: </b>Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table 2&#150;6 under &#147;Spells Known.&#148; These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.</p>
			<p><b>Revelation: </b>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new secret about her mystery that grants her powers and abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.</p>
			<p><b>Final Revelation: </b>At 20th level, an oracle learns the final revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle&#146;s mystery.</p>
