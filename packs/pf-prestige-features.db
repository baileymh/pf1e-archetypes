The pool of favor is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the Westcrown devil gains levels, he learns to call upon powers inspired by specific founders. The caster level of spell-like abilities used this way is equal to the character's class level. Effects (including spell-like abilities) that allow a saving throw have a DC equal to 10 + the Westcrown devil's class level + the Westcrown devil's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eye of Vadrus (Su)<p><p>The patron of glassmakers allows the Westcrown devil to turn walls to glass. At 1st level, as a fullround action that costs 1 favor point, the Westcrown devil can see the internal workings of a lock, trap, or similar device that he touches. He gains a +4 bonus on Disable Device checks to disable this device. At 4th level, he can use eye of Vadrus to see through a section of any door or wall he is adjacent to and touches, as though a section of that wall or door no larger than 5 square feet were transparent. This effect works only on walls or doors that are no thicker than 6 inches. This effect lasts 1 round per class level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Crucisal's Guidance (Su)<p><p>The patron of navigation guides the Westcrown devil while hindering any pursuit. At 3rd level, when in an urban environment, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as a swift action to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his base speed and a +4 insight bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks for 1 minute. Whenever the Westcrown devil spends favor to improve a skill check as part of a chase (GameMastery Guide 232) or pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142), he adds 2d6 to his check instead of 1d6.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Adel's Craftsmanship (Sp)<p><p>The patron of woodcraft imparts mastery over such creations. At 5th level, as a standard action, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use warp wood or meld into wood (as per meld into stone, except that the wood can be of any size or dimensions). If the Westcrown devil is 8th level or higher, he can use this ability as passwall through wooden barriers or statue to assume the form of a statue made of wood (hardness 5) instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rixana's Bounty (Sp)<p><p>Calling upon the patron of the bounty of deep waters allows for safe navigation of underwater regions. At 7th level, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as an immediate action to grant the benefits of water breathing for 24 hours. When he activates this ability, he can affect other creatures he can touch by spending 1 additional favor point for each added creature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Palmor's Recovery (Sp)<p><p>The patron of renewal grants access to powerful healing. At 8th level, as a standard action, a Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use cure serious wounds or lesser restoration. He can spend 3 favor points in a 1-minute ritual to use break enchantment or restoration (requiring expensive material components as appropriate).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dotara's Shroud (Su)<p><p>Experienced Westcrown devils gain the favor of the patron of the dottari (city guard). At 9th level, the Westcrown devil gains a +5 insight bonus on all skill checks opposed by or targeting city guards, a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks from city guards, and a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against effects created by city guards. This ability is constant and applies only while the Westcrown devil has at least 1 favor point remaining.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Arodennama's Avatar (Su or Sp)<p><p>Westcrown's greatest monument, the Arodennama, symbolizes the dead god of humanity, and the Westcrown devil can draw inspiration from this towering statue to invoke Aroden's authority or mastery of the blade. At 10th level, the Westcrown devil can use his favor ability to improve attack rolls with longswords as if they were skill checks. In addition, as a full-round action, the Westcrown devil can spend 2 favor points to issue a suggestion, or spend 5 favor points to issue a mass suggestion. These function as the spells of the same name except that they affect only humans.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[["Westcrown Devil"],["Prestige Feature"]],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"featType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":[["{{PrestigeClass"]]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"su","crOffset":""},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"Xvf2K3vr5xWPRXqs"}

The Cyphermage must be at least 8th level to select this lore.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Defensive Scrollcaster (Ex)</p><p>The Cyphermage gains a +4 bonus on concentration checks to cast spells defensively when casting spells from scrolls.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Enhance Scroll (Su)</p><p>As a swift action, the Cyphermage can cause any scroll spell he reads to function using his caster level rather than the scroll's caster level. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-third his Cyphermage level (minimum 1).</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Extended Scroll (Su)</p><p>As a swift action, the Cyphermage can double the duration of any spell he reads from a scroll as if the spell were modified by Extend Spell. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-third his Cyphermage level (minimum 1).</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Focused Scroll (Su)</p><p>As a swift action, the Cyphermage can add a bonus equal to twice his Intelligence modifier on any caster level checks attempted when activating a scroll spell, including checks to overcome spell resistance. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-third his Cyphermage level (minimum 1).</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Giant's Master (Ex)</p><p>The Cyphermage has unraveled several of Thassilon's methods of commanding and controlling giants. As a swift action whenever he uses a mind-affecting spell or effect on a humanoid with the giant subtype, he increases the DCs of spells he casts by 2. The Cyphermage must be at least 6th level to select this lore.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Glyph Finder (Ex)</p><p>The Cyphermage can locate glyphs of warding, symbol spells, and similar magical spell traps that use writing as if he were a rogue. He can use Perception or Knowledge (arcana) to notice such traps, and can use Disable Device or Spellcraft to disable these types of traps.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Insightful Scroll (Su)</p><p>As a swift action, the Cyphermage can alter a spell he's casting from a scroll to use his own spellcasting ability score (for example, Intelligence for wizards) and relevant feats to set the save DC for the spell. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-third his Cyphermage level (minimum 1).</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Rune Trap (Ex)</p><p>Whenever the Cyphermage casts a spell that creates a trap that uses magical writing (such as explosive runes, illusory script, sepia snake sigil, or a symbol spell), as a swift action he can include Thassilonian runes in the writing. This increases the Perception DCs to notice it, Disable Device DCs to disarm it, and caster level DCs to dispel it by 4. The Cyphermage must be at least 6th level to select this lore.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Swift Scrivener (Ex)</p><p>The Cyphermage can scribe up to two scrolls per day, so long as the total market price of all scrolls scribed that day does not exceed 1,000 gp. The Cyphermage reduces the casting time of all symbol spells to 1 minute.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Swift Scroll (Ex)</p><p>The Cyphermage does not provoke attacks of opportunity when retrieving a stored scroll. If the Cyphermage moves at least 10 feet, he can retrieve a scroll as a free action combined with his movement.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Thassilonian Focus (Ex)</p><p>The Cyphermage chooses one of the seven schools of Thassilonian magic, as detailed on page 63 (if the Cyphermage is a Thassilonian specialist [see page 63], he must choose the same school of magic for his Thassilonian focus as he chose for his specialization). He gains a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities from that school of magic.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Thassilonian Incantation (Su)</p><p>The Cyphermage has discovered a way to empower language-dependent spells when speaking Thassilonian. When he does so, the save DCs of the spells increase by 1, but those targeted by such a spell's effects must still be able to understand Thassilonian to be affected by it. If the Cyphermage also has the rune trap cypher lore, the Cyphermage can include Thassilonian runes in any spell he casts that creates magical writing (such as a symbol or explosive runes). Doing so doubles the spell's casting time, but causes the spell effect to manifest at +1 caster level.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Thassilonian Summoning (Ex)</p><p>The Cyphermage has learned how to summon strange creatures to his aid when he casts certain summon monster spells.

At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, the mystic inscribes a new tattoo on his body, chosen from the list below. Mystic tattoos do not occupy magic item or tattoo slots on his body. The mystic can select each tattoo more than once; the effects of multiple tattoos are noted in their descriptions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tattoo: Binding Trine</p><p>This triangular design allows the mystic to transform a hostile spell affecting him into a magical tattoo, similar to a reservoir tattoo (Inner Sea Magic 16). When the mystic fails a saving throw against a spell of 3rd level or lower that targets only him, he gets a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If he succeeds at this check, he can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level as an immediate action to bind the spell, suppressing its effects and suspending its duration for a number of rounds equal to his level. Only spells with a duration longer than instantaneous can be bound this way, and only one spell can be held at a time. While bound, the spell can be dispelled or removed as normal. The maximum spell level this tattoo can bind increases by 2 each time it's selected, to a maximum of 9th level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tattoo: Blistering Bands</p><p>These glowing, angular markings encircle the mystic's arms. Whenever the mystic casts an evocation spell that deals energy damage, he can spend a swift action to surround himself with an aura of that same energy until the beginning of his next turn. Creatures adjacent to the mystic when he activates the ability or that end their turns adjacent to him take 1d6 points of damage of the same energy type as the evocation spell. If the spell deals more than one type of energy damage, the mystic must choose which of those types of damage his aura deals. Selecting this tattoo additional times increases the damage dealt by 2d6, to a maximum of 7d6.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tattoo: Flickering Eye</p><p>The skin beneath this stylized eye seems partially translucent and insubstantial. When the mystic spends a standard action to concentrate on an ongoing illusion effect created by one of his spells, he gains concealment (20% miss chance) until the beginning of his next turn. Effects that negate invisibility negate this miss chance. When this tattoo is chosen a second time, the miss chance increases to 50%. When it's chosen a third time, the mystic instead becomes invisible, as per the spell invisibility, until the beginning of his next turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tattoo: Pouncing Beasts</p><p>These bestial pictographs seem poised to leap off the mystic's skin. The mystic can cast summon monster and summon nature's ally spells of up to 3rd level as a standard action, rather than a full-round action, provided all the creatures summoned enter play adjacent to him. The maximum spell level the tattoo can affect increases by 2 each time it's selected, to a maximum of 9th level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tattoo: Rune of Fangs</p><p>These jagged runes cover the mystic's face, giving him a bestial expression. While polymorphed or otherwise transformed into a form with natural attacks, the mystic gains an enhancement bonus on his attack and damage rolls equal to 1/2 his level with one natural attack, chosen when he assumes that form. Each time he selects this tattoo, he can choose one additional natural attack to apply the bonus to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tattoo: Swallowing Glyph</p><p>This ornate, shadowy glyph absorbs the souls of those the mystic slays. Any time the mystic slays a creature with a necromancy spell, he can spend a swift action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell's level. Temporary hit points gained from subsequent uses of this ability do not stack. The second time this tattoo is selected, the number of temporary hit points increases to double the spell's level. The third time it's selected, the number increases to triple the spell's level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tattoo: Twisting Script</p><p>The indistinct shapes that form this spiral tattoo twist into legible text when scrutinized. Creatures within 30 feet of the mystic that can see him are affected by his language-dependent enchantment spells, even if they do not understand the language he speaks. Creatures without a language are immune to this effect.

The enemy must be able to reach the opportunist, and the opportunist must activate this ability as an immediate action and succeed at a combat maneuver check against the enemy's CMD; at the GM's discretion, the opportunist can substitute another ability score modifier for her Strength modifier when making her combat maneuver check (such as using Dexterity for an agility-related action or Charisma for a social-related action).

She succeeds and will gain the aid another bonus on her Climb check on her next turn. The GM rolls the ogre's attack with a �2 penalty, hits Piria, and deals damage, but Piria still gets the aid another bonus on her next Acrobatics check- perhaps as the ogre's club hit her, she grabbed it, flipped onto it, and on her turn can jump from the swinging club using the +2 bonus from aid another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[["Halfling Opportunist"],["Prestige Feature"]],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"featType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":[["{{PrestigeClass"]]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":""},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/halfling.png","effects":[],"_id":"pbDjwalaa7ZrWfs3"}
