Although enchanting courtesans are most commonly trained by the church of Calistria, their much-sought-after skills can be found in groups across Golarion, from the Tallow Boys of Kaer Maga to students of Jalmeray&rsquo;s Conservatory. Although some enchanting courtesans work with spy organizations, others sell their services to please or humiliate high-profile targets. In order to avoid alienating clients, enchanting courtesans usually take great pains to exploit and sell their knowledge only through intermediaries such as highly professional thieves&rsquo; guilds.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>In order to qualify to become an enchanting courtesan, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Either Spell Focus (divination) or Spell Focus (enchantment).<br /><strong> Skills</strong>: Bluff 5 ranks; Knowledge (arcana) 2 ranks; Sense Motive 5 ranks; Perform (act) or Perform (dance) 2 ranks.<br /><strong> Spells</strong>: Ability to cast two different divination spells and two different enchantment spells.

Upon doing so, the enchanting courtesan must attempt a Bluff check, as well as a Sleight of Hand check if the spell has somatic, material, or focus components. Observers do not notice that a spell has been cast unless they succeed at both a Sense Motive check opposing the courtesan&rsquo;s Bluff check and a Perception check opposing the courtesan&rsquo;s Sleight of Hand check (if any). If the enchanting courtesan has another ability that allows spells to be hidden in a similar fashion, he gains a +2 bonus on these checks. Casting the spell does not provoke attacks of opportunity from foes unaware of the spellcasting.<br /><br /><strong>Enchanting Touch (Su)</strong>: An enchanting courtesan can deliver a divination or enchantment spell with a touch, usually a kiss or erotic gesture, to a target that is willing to be touched by him. The target takes a &ndash;4 penalty on skill checks to notice or identify the spell being cast.<br /><br /><strong>Seducer&rsquo;s Leverage (Ex)</strong>: An enchanting courtesan develops a vast network of informants, comprised of those who have succumbed to his wiles or purchased his services, or whose secrets and goals he learned in turn from other informants. The enchanting courtesan can determine the influence any one individual has with any one organization or other individual once per day by consulting the network for 1 hour. Doing so also reveals the attitudes of the two parties in question toward each other, unless their particular relationship is a well-kept secret. The enchanting courtesan also gains 1 edge per 3 class levels that can be used in any verbal duel involving or regarding one or more of the characters or group members in question. See Chapters 3 and 4 of <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue</em> for more information on influence and verbal duels, respectively.<br /><br /><strong>Poison Use (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an enchanting courtesan is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon.<br /><br /><strong>Seductive Intuition (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, an enchanting courtesan gains a competence bonus equal to half his class level on Bluff, Diplomacy, Sense Motive, and Sleight of Hand checks. He can use his total Sense Motive modifier in place of his total modifiers on Diplomacy and Sleight of Hand checks against targets who could be sexually attracted to him.<br /><br /><strong>Hidden Spell (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, an enchanting courtesan can undermine a foe&rsquo;s mental defenses with surprise. The enchanting courtesan gains a +1 circumstance bonus to the save DC of his spells against foes who are unaware of his presence or consider him an ally. In these circumstances, the enchanting courtesan also gains a +1 circumstance bonus on caster level checks to overcome targets&rsquo; spell resistance and to penetrate abjurations such as <em>nondetection</em>.<br /><br />At 6th level, the bonuses increase to +2. A 6th-level enchanting courtesan can also undermine the mental defenses of a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the bonuses are each reduced by 1.<br /><br />At 9th level, the bonuses increase to +3, or +2 if the foe is merely flanked or denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.<br /><br /><strong>Master Poisoner (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an enchanting courtesan can use Craft (alchemy) to change a poison&rsquo;s type. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist&rsquo;s lab and a Craft (alchemy) skill check (DC = the poison&rsquo;s save DC). If he&rsquo;s successful, the poison&rsquo;s type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If he fails the check, the poison is ruined. The enchanting courtesan receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level on Craft (alchemy) skill checks when working with poison.<br /><br /><strong>Contact Poison Wielder (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, an enchanting courtesan can wield a dose of contact poison as a melee weapon. Delivering the poison requires a touch attack. The enchanting courtesan can prevent foes from noticing he is armed with a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by observers&rsquo; Perception checks. The enchanting courtesan gains a +2 bonus on this Sleight of Hand check. The enchanting courtesan can draw and open a dose of contact poison as a swift action. If he has the Quick Draw feat, he gains the ability to draw and open a dose of contact poison as part of rolling initiative if his hands are free and the dose of poison is not hidden.<br /><br /><strong>Deluding Touch (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, an enchanting courtesan can subtly deliver an attack by touch. His caress is so pleasurable that the target doesn&rsquo;t automatically realize it was attacked. If the target succeeds at a saving throw against a spell delivered via enchanting touch or a contact poison delivered via the contact poison wielder ability, there is a chance it doesn&rsquo;t notice the attack. The target attempts the saving throw again using all the same modifiers; if it fails this saving throw, it doesn&rsquo;t notice that anything is amiss even though it successfully resisted the effect.<br /><br /><strong>Informative Liaisons (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, the enchanting courtesan has developed a network of contacts in each settlement in which he has spent at least 1 month. In this settlement, once per week, he can take 20 on one Diplomacy check to gather information without increasing the time to perform the action beyond the normal 1d4 hours. In addition, he can determine the result of one Propaganda check to spread or suppress a rumor (see page 14) per week as if he had rolled a 20 on the die.<br /><br /><strong>Overwhelming Touch (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, an enchanting courtesan&rsquo;s touch is deceptively and overwhelmingly entrancing. The enchanting courtesan&rsquo;s target must roll twice and take the worse result on saving throws against spells delivered via enchanting touch.<br /><br /><strong>Touch of Ecstasy (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, an enchanting courtesan has perfectly mastered the sensual arts. As a standard action, the enchanting courtesan can touch a living target to saturate its being with pure bliss. An unwilling target can be affected with a melee touch attack. The target is filled with ecstatic pleasure for 1d4 rounds. The pleasure suppresses all pain<sup>UM</sup> effects during this time. The target must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 20 + the enchanting courtesan&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier). If it succeeds at this saving throw, the target is staggered for the duration. If it fails, it is stunned instead. This is a mind-affecting emotion<sup>UM</sup> effect. Any effect or immunity that prevents precision damage negates this ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3VYI9pWPy17ZPGGg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Contact Poison Wielder (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":4,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AsX63pTWDTd9RjSr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Covert Spells (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vgv3rPqwDpPHhobH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deluding Touch (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AADeI9AH0yvh6cwW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Enchanting Touch (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.CSRimOtiqsmzjmGG","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hidden Spell (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.OaxkpBtQv55goKpa","dataType":"compendium","name":"Informative Liaisons (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":7,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.f5IZh3FE9Vj3pFxH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master Poisoner (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MQeH5DitS16Rv0I2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Overwhelming Touch (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":8,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.R7u5zwDkaWjgEsxF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Poison Use (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":2,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6w57elcfvcPFd5fh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Seducer's Leverage (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":1,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KCI6s5ij0fU3KeJk","dataType":"compendium","name":"Seductive Intuition (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":2,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sLhmnjlp5mUsWLLL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Touch of Ecstasy (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-heart.webp","level":10,"_index":11}]},"tag":"enchantingCourtesan","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They rely on physical strength&mdash;but also quick wits&mdash;to overcome oppressors. Since charging blindly into battle could result in a prisoner&rsquo;s death, liberators plan their rescues carefully.<br /><br />Liberators despise slavers above all others, particularly races well known for these practices, such as the gnolls. While some liberators operate solely in cities, most dwell in or near territories held by known slaver organizations or groups. Liberators typically strike under the cover of darkness, and they usually seek to smuggle slaves to safety without alerting any guards. As a result, liberators develop many abilities related to navigating darkness and stealth.<br /><br />In large cities, the law typically views the actions of liberators as dangerous, since they often show no respect for traditional investigative procedures. These feelings of distrust and disdain are shared by most liberators, who tend to see the law as a lumbering, ineffective giant. Liberators often operate in the shadows of society as a result, lest they become prisoners themselves. Rarely, city officials view liberators as expensive but effective mercenaries who bring results the average guardsman cannot. Liberators often find work in such cities, and in return gain cautious but respectful accolades for their deeds.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a liberator, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any nonlawful.<br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Escape Artist 6 ranks, Open Lock 6 ranks.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Stealthy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Liberator's class skills are Climb, Escape Artist, Gather Information, Hide, Intimidate, Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (local), Open Lock, Search, Sense Motive, Survival, Use Rope.<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Poison resistance +2, to the rescue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Lockbreaker +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Bonus feat, silent sunder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Lockbreaker +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Slaver's ruin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Greater sunder, lockbreaker +3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Poison resistance +4, steely resolve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Darkvision, lockbreaker +4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Quick pick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65134%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1643%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.2719%;\">Freedom of movement, lockbreaker +5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the liberator.<br /><br /><strong>To the Rescue (Su)</strong>: The sight of a liberator staging a daring rescue proves inspirational to his allies. As a standard action, the liberator can shout an encouraging phrase or raise a rallying cry to bring hope to those awaiting rescue. All allies within 30 feet of the liberator gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, a +4 morale bonus on Escape Artist checks, and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws made against fear effects. These bonuses persist for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the liberator&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).<br /><br /><strong>Poison Resistance (Ex)</strong>: Slavers often make liberal use of poison and drugs to keep their captives lethargic and under control. A liberator purposefully exposes himself to a variety of venoms in order to build up a resistance to such toxins, should he ever fall victim to those he opposes. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws made against poisons. This bonus increases to +4 at 7th level.<br /><br /><strong>Lockbreaker (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 2nd level, a liberator receives a competence bonus equal to half his class level on all Open Lock checks. He also gains this bonus on all Escape Artist checks made to escape bindings, shackles, and other restraints.<br /><br /><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: At 3rd level, the liberator gains a bonus feat. He must qualify for the feat, and it must be from the following list: Blind-Fight, Iron Will, or Skill Focus (any class skill).<br /><br /><strong>Silent Sunder (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a liberator learns methods of applying force and striking objects in such a way as to minimize noise. He can choose to make no more noise than people talking when making a sunder attack action or attempting to break an object with a Strength check.<br /><br /><strong>Slaver&rsquo;s Ruin (Ex)</strong>: The sight of imprisonment and slavery can drive a liberator into a righteous frenzy. A liberator of at least 5th level can designate one creature engaged in such acts as the target of his wrath. The designated foe is considered flat-footed against the liberator&rsquo;s next attack. Opponents who cannot be caught flat-footed (such as through improved uncanny dodge) are immune to this effect.<br /><br /><strong>Greater Sunder (Ex)</strong>: Beginning at 6th level, a liberator ignores half of an object&rsquo;s hardness when making a sunder attack or attacking an object. He also gains a +2 morale bonus on his opposed attack roll when making a sunder attempt (but not when defending against a sunder attempt).<br /><br /><strong>Steely Resolve (Ex)</strong>: A liberator fears magical domination more than anything else, for the enslavement of the mind is difficult to detect and remove. At 7th level, whenever a liberator is targeted by a charm or compulsion effect and fails his saving throw, he may attempt his saving throw again 1 round later at the same DC to resist the effect. He gets only this one extra chance to throw off any one effect.<br /><br /><strong>Darkvision (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a liberator has spent so much time sneaking through the dark to free the victims of unjust imprisonment that he develops darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If the liberator already possesses darkvision, the range of his darkvision increases by 60 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Quick Pick (Ex)</strong>: There&rsquo;s not always time to properly pick a lock, and sometimes liberators have to improvise. At 9th level, a liberator has perfected the art of lockpicking to such an extent that he may attempt an Open Locks check as a move action instead of a full-round action without any additional penalties.<br /><br /><strong>Freedom of Movement (Su)</strong> At 10th level, the liberator&rsquo;s focus against slavery and restriction to mobility develops into a potent resistance to restraint. He is now treated as if under the effects of a <em>freedom of movement</em> spell at all times. This ability cannot be dispelled. Once per day, he can also use <em>freedom of movement</em> as a spell-like ability (caster level equals his class level) to share this benefit with others.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.j6PYH91fK22X3iCb","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Feat","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":3,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9jCL5GcUBySFjSsE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Darkvision (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":8,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TdL3rLVffSVvwegK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Freedom of Movement (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":10,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.umr9pzGSXWhyVxX3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Sunder (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":6,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6QPYuJ1grudBotuu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Lockbreaker (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eBMtTdKIROnXb5fF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Poison Resistance (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kurYn8UcuCkOKNbp","dataType":"compendium","name":"Quick Pick (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":9,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.11hwygTuY1sILaeS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Silent Sunder (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":3,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kjrYwoNq2MXNNhMo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Slaver's Ruin (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":4,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MGHI15x1NEZIdFx0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Steely Resolve (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":7,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KCzCnIRL0kXH8Aaz","dataType":"compendium","name":"To the Rescue (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/survival/cuffs-shackles-steel.webp","level":1,"_index":10}]},"tag":"liberator","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":true,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Proficiency</strong>: A technomancer gains proficiency with all firearms.<br /><br /><strong>Recondition (Su)</strong>: Through constant maintenance, a technomancer can keep a single piece of still-functioning timeworn technology in good working order. Reconditioning a timeworn technological item takes 8 hours, after which the item no longer has a chance of glitching when used by the technomancer and can be recharged normally by the technomancer but no one else. Keeping the item working requires 1 hour of maintenance each day (this can overlap with the time needed to prepare spells), or the item reverts to a normal piece of timeworn technology and must be reconditioned again. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a technomancer can keep an additional item in good working order, without increasing his daily maintenance time.<br /><br /><strong>Technical Expertise (Ex)</strong>: A technomancer adds his class level to Craft, Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), and Linguistics checks regarding technology.<br /><br /><strong>Efficient Construction (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a technomancer using a technological crafting lab reduces the necessary energy expenditure of the facility by 25%. At 10th level, this energy reduction increases to 50%.<br /><br /><strong>Technic Spell Mastery (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a technomancer selects one of the following spells: <em>antitech field</em>, <em>destroy robot</em>, <em>detect radiation</em>, <em>discharge</em>, <em>greater discharge</em>, <em>greater remove radioactivity</em>, <em>infuse robot</em>, <em>irradiate</em>, <em>magic circle against technology</em>, <em>memory of function</em>, <em>rebuke technology</em>, <em>recharge</em>, <em>remove radioactivity</em>, <em>protection from technology</em>, or <em>technomancy</em>. (Additional technology-related spells can be added to this list at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.) If the spell chosen isn&rsquo;t one that&rsquo;s normally on his class spell list, he adds it to his class spell list at the level a wizard casts the spell. The spell chosen must be of a spell level he would otherwise be able to cast. If he prepares spells, he can prepare this spell one additional time in excess of the normal maximum number of spells he can prepare. If he casts spells spontaneously, he adds the spell to his spells known, and can cast this spell once per day without using a daily spell slot.<br /><br />At 5th level, he picks another spell from the list above, and at 8th level, he picks a 3rd spell from the list above.<br /><br /><strong>Arcane Battery (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level as a swift action, a technomancer can expend an unused spell slot (if he&rsquo;s a spontaneous caster) or a prepared spell (if he prepares spells) to power a technological device he touches. Each spell level expended in this way grants the device 1 charge. Any charges unused at the end of the round are lost, and any charges used by the device that round that aren&rsquo;t provided by the technomancer must come from the device&rsquo;s own power reserves. He can use this ability to power timeworn technology. He can&rsquo;t power devices that don&rsquo;t use charges.<br /><br /><strong>Study Technology (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a technomancer can study a robot, technological object, or technological trap within 30 feet as a move action and attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to identify it. If he succeeds, he gains a competence bonus equal to 1/2 his level on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, saving throws, and skill checks involving the studied creature, object, or trap, as well as a dodge bonus of the same amount against attacks from the subject of his study. This bonus lasts a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If he studies a new subject, he loses his bonus against the previous subject.<br /><br /><strong>Recycle Technology (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a technomancer can dismantle existing technological items and construct new ones from the parts, though such creations are prone to malfunctioning. He trades in each item for an amount of crafting potential based on a fraction of its crafting cost (not price), as described below. He can use this potential and his technological crafting feats to make a new item. For example, a technomancer could use a broken laser pistol in place of 500 gp for crafting technological items (10% of the laser pistol&rsquo;s crafting cost of 5,000 gp). He then follows the normal rules for crafting a technological item (see page 16), except that he must pay at least 50% of the crafting cost using recycled technology. If he pays 100% of the cost in this fashion, he crafts the item at double the normal speed. In the process of cannibalizing the old items, the new items are destroyed and any excess gold value is lost. The item he creates is considered timeworn technology, even if new items were broken down to build it. Recycle technology cannot be used to build constructs, cybertech, pharmaceuticals, or technology that uses nanites.<br /><br /></p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Technology Status</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Crafting Potential</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fully functioning</td>\n<td>100% of crafting cost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reconditioned</td>\n<td>75% of crafting cost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeworn technology</td>\n<td>50% of crafting cost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Broken or nonfunctional</td>\n<td>10% of crating cost</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br /><strong>Command Robot (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, a technomancer can issue a command to a robot within 30 feet as a standard action once per day. The command must be in a language the robot can understand. The robot can resist the effects of this ability by succeeding at a Will saving throw against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the technomancer&rsquo;s class level + the technomancer&rsquo;s Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher). At 7th level, a technomancer can use this ability twice per day, and at 9th level he can use it three times per day. This ability otherwise functions as <em>suggestion</em>, save that it is not mind-affecting and can only affect constructs with the robot subtype.<br /><br /><strong>Unified Energy (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a technomancer can draw power from a technological device in his possession to cast a spell he knows (if a spontaneous caster) or a spell he currently has prepared (if he prepares spells) without expending a spell slot or prepared spell. He consumes 2 charges from the device for each spell level of the spell being cast. In the process of casting the spell, he can apply any of his metamagic feats, using a number of charges appropriate to the increase in spell level, but he cannot exceed the highest effective level of spell he is able to cast. He can use this ability multiple times per day, but never in excess of a number of charges equal to twice his technomancer level (so at 6th level, he can consume no more than 12 charges per day using this ability).<br /><br /><strong>Applied Learning (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, when a technomancer succeeds at a saving throw against a technological effect that has reduced effects on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless or flat-footed technomancer does not benefit from this ability.<br /><br /><strong>Field Improvisation (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a technomancer can recycle technology with astounding speed. Each hour of crafting when using his recycle technology ability is equivalent to 8 hours of uninterrupted crafting; he can perform up to 8 hours of such amazingly efficient work per day. Any item he completes is treated as reconditioned for the remainder of that day. It can be added permanently to his group of reconditioned items if he has an available slot or stops maintaining one of his current reconditioned items.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.twwQRlUMKlFM6uR4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Applied Learning (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":8,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QlpIrJspsbDVUYwi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Arcane Battery (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.J6Kls73XgdvogAgw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Command Robot (Sp)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fGb6orlkbrE82gjo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Efficient Construction (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5b09x5SNhbpFfyQf","dataType":"compendium","name":"Field Improvisation (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":10,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FELX9fqT227Z1mJ3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Recondition (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aoiDCs3tbK8FM67G","dataType":"compendium","name":"Recycle Technology (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":4,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8iEcTEpCKgs5adln","dataType":"compendium","name":"Study Technology (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":3,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.nrOFCv40PaQ8dSPj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Technic Spell Mastery (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":2,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Ro84sev5iCm1B72u","dataType":"compendium","name":"Technical Expertise (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":1,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IJ1jE4oTPklquiMj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unified Energy (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-brass.webp","level":6,"_index":10}]},"tag":"technomancer","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"all firearms"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":true,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

These scions of the hurricane take the name of Storm Kindler as more than merely the organization they belong to&mdash;they seek to develop not only power to manipulate storms, but also the ability to awaken the storms within their own bodies, physically transforming into vortexes of destruction.<br /><br />The first to learn these secrets were among the original members of the organization that braved the Eye of Abendego a century ago. For generations, the methods of kindling storms in this way were lost, but the current incarnation of the organization has recovered those secrets, and today the lore has spread far and wide&mdash;many of those who join the Storm Kindler sect seek to gain power as actual Storm Kindlers.<br /><br />While some of those who successfully take levels in this prestige class arrogantly proclaim themselves the true heart of the Storm Kindler organization, most instead view themselves as embodying the spirit of the storm but understand that, just as no two storms are alike, no two members of their organization need be identical in outlook or power. Their more open-minded approach and willingness to work with diverse groups frustrates and worries the traditionalists among their kind, and a powerful and vocal minority increasingly threatens to force a schism on the organization as a whole.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Storm Kindler, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br

equal to her class level on Fly and Swim checks, and never needs to attempt concentration checks because of natural weather. She gains resistance to electricity 5 and sonic 5. At 5th level, her resistance to electricity and sonic increases to 10. At 9th level, these resistances increase to 20.<br /><br /><strong> Seasight (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Storm Kindler can see through fog, smoke, and other obscuring vapors as if they did not exist. This ability functions underwater as well, allowing the Storm Kindler to see through thick silt and other aquatic precipitates.<br /><br /><strong> Storm Shape (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Storm Kindler becomes a physical embodiment of the fury of the storm. As a standard action, she can transform herself into a whirlwind (as per the universal monster rule, <em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 306</em>) for a number of minutes per day equal to her Storm Kindler level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. If the Storm Kindler is underwater when she uses this ability, she instead transforms into a vortex of the same size (this functions identically to the whirlwind ability, but can form only underwater and can&rsquo;t leave the water). The Storm Kindler can breathe water while in vortex form. If the Storm Kindler does not have a fly or swim speed, she gains one (as appropriate to her new form) equal to her base land speed while in storm shape. With a fly speed, she has average maneuverability.<br /><br />As a swift action, the Storm Kindler can change the height of her whirlwind form from a minimum of 10 feet tall to a maximum of 20 feet tall. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the maximum height of the whirlwind increases by 10 feet, to a maximum of 60 feet tall at 10th level.<br /><br />The Storm Kindler can damage and trap Small or smaller creatures caught in her whirlwind, dealing lethal damage equal to her unarmed strike damage to each such creature that fails a Reflex save (DC = 10 + the Storm Kindler&rsquo;s class level + the Storm Kindler&rsquo;s Strength modifier) and lifting it into the air if it fails a second Reflex save. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the size of creatures the Storm Kindler can affect increases by one step, to a maximum of Huge at 8th level.<br /><br /><strong> Aura of Calm (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, allies within 5 feet of a Storm Kindler (including herself ) are treated as one size category larger for the purpose of wind effects (this stacks with the bonus from Storm-Lashed), and they gain a +2 competence bonus on all saving throws to resist spells and effects with the air or water descriptors. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the Storm Kindler&rsquo;s aura of calm extends by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet at 9th level). At 7th level, allies in the Storm Kindler&rsquo;s aura are treated as two size categories larger for the purpose of wind effects, and the bonus on saving throws doubles to +4.<br /><br /><strong> Wave Breaker (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a Storm Kindler gains a swim speed equal to twice her base land speed. She can breathe water for a number of hours per day equal to her Storm Kindler level. This time need not be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-hour increments.<br /><br /><strong> Thunderstruck (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a Storm Kindler becomes immune to the deafened condition.<br /><br /><strong> Weather&rsquo;s Fury (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a Storm Kindler can deal additional damage with her storm shape. In addition to her unarmed strike damage, she deals 3d6 points of electricity damage (while in whirlwind form) or cold damage (while in vortex form) to each creature that fails its Reflex saves. This damage increases to 4d6 at 8th level, and 5d6 at 10th level.<br /><br /><strong> Eye of the Storm (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a Storm Kindler becomes immune to damage and detrimental effects from nonmagical wind and waves. In addition, she receives a +4 insight bonus on saving throws and to AC against spells and effects with the air or water descriptors.<br /><br /><strong> Fickle Winds (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, as a swift action, a Storm Kindler can call the winds to her defense, protecting her as per the spell <em>fickle winds<sup>APG</sup></em> for a number of rounds per day equal to her level. These rounds need not be consecutive.<br /><br /><strong> Echoing Thunder (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, anytime a Storm Kindler resists electricity or sonic damage with her oceanic spirit ability, she can spend an immediate action to redirect the damage to another creature within 30 feet. The creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + the Storm Kindler&rsquo;s class level + the Storm Kindler&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) or take an amount of electricity or sonic damage equal to the amount the Storm Kindler resisted.<br /><br /><strong> Storm Mastery (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Storm Kindler becomes one with the relentless fury of the storm, allowing her to use her storm shape ability at will. In addition to this, she gains a fly speed equal to double her base land speed, and gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality. The Storm Kindler never takes the normal penalties on her attack or damage rolls for fighting underwater.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cUagLrkUg75Lzq0T","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aura of Calm (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":3,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Az0H28jqTRoiYLde","dataType":"compendium","name":"Echoing Thunder (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":9,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.xGwfO0LGSpeBvcIp","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eye of the Storm (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":7,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.VBUnbageuuu32UYK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Fickle Winds (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":8,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.njhC71bB9E3EK9N1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Oceanic Spirit (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Kcr7mJilpNwLLcrm","dataType":"compendium","name":"Seasight (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.C0u42FPGoteCIemF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Storm Mastery (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":10,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.O8OAFDU1c7tK9NsQ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Storm Shape (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":2,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ziUjbxZtdLGiffVc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Thunderstruck (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":5,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.knfcYfPniQcT4u3F","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wave Breaker (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":4,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9wuL3xMSJw7BeaJj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Weather's Fury (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/lighting-reflexes.jpg","level":6,"_index":10}]},"tag":"stormKindler","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

While elves still hold a majority in the organization and its base of operations remains in Kyonin, any who seek to further the group&rsquo;s goals are welcome as members. The same goes for those passionate about opposing demonic influences or threats from the Darklands. These dedicated soldiers and redeemers, called Lantern Bearers after the group that gave rise to them, form the backbone of that organization.<br /><br />While Lantern Bearers direct the majority of their missions and goals in the Darklands, particularly in fighting against the machinations of the drow, they have increasingly turned to surface regions where demonic corruptions similar to those suffusing drow society have erupted. The primary focus is on the doorstep of their own homeland of Kyonin: the swampy realm of Tanglebriar, where the nascent demon lord Treerazer rules. The Worldwound has also seen a considerable number of Lantern Bearers joining the crusade, but they are increasingly encountered throughout the Inner Sea region, especially as drow agents and their influences on surface world interests become more and more apparent.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Lantern Bearer, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong> Alignment</strong>: Any good. <br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (dungeoneering) 5 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 2 ranks, Survival 5 ranks. <strong>Weapon Proficiency</strong>: Must be proficient with the longbow (or composite longbow) and one martial melee weapon.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Lantern Bearer's class skills are Heal (Wis), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Survival (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">Lantern arcana, luminous potency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">1st favored enemy, bitter armament</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">Lantern arcana, superior discernment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">Unbounded stride</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">Lantern arcana, proven weapon familiarity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">Celestial weaponry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">Fade from sight, lantern arcana</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">2nd favored enemy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">Aiudara alignment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.6178%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.5065%;\">Bringer of brightness</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Lantern Bearer prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Lantern Arcana (Sp)</strong> A Lantern Bearer gains a series of spell-like abilities. The Lantern Bearer&rsquo;s caster level for these effects is equal to her character level, and the save DC is equal to 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + her Intelligence modifier. To use a spell-like ability, she must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell-like ability&rsquo;s spell level.<br /><br />A Lantern Bearer gains additional abilities as she advances in level. When she initially gains access to a set of spell-like abilities of 1st or higher level, she can use each spell-like ability once per day. For every 2 class levels after she gains a specific set of spell-like abilities, she gains an additional use per day of each ability in that set. (For example, a 3rd-level Lantern Bearer can use <em>darkvision</em>, <em>delay poison</em>, and <em>see invisibility</em> each once per day, and <em>faerie fire</em>, <em>pass without trace</em>, and <em>protection from evil</em> each twice per day.)<br /><br /><em>At Will</em>: <em>Dancing lights</em>, <em>light</em>, and <em>spark<sup>APG</sup></em>.<br /><em>1st Level</em>: <em>Faerie fire</em>, <em>pass without trace</em>, and <em>protection from evil</em>.<br /><em>3rd Level</em>: <em>Darkvision</em> (self only), <em>delay poison</em> (self only), and <em>see invisibility</em>.<br /><em>5th Level</em>: <em>Continual flame</em> (3rd-level spell, lasts up to 10 minutes per level; a Lantern Bearer within 20 feet of a continual flame she created using this ability can extinguish it to cast <em>searing light</em>), <em>dispel magic</em>, and <em>magic circle against evil</em> (self only).<br /><em>7th Level</em>: Heightened <em>daylight</em> (heightened to a 4th-level spell), <em>dimensional anchor</em>, and <em>freedom of movement</em> (self only).<br /><br /><strong> Luminous Potency (Su)</strong>: When casting spells from other classes or using lantern arcana spell-like abilities, a Lantern Bearer gains an additional bonus equal to her Lantern Bearer class level on caster level checks for the purpose of overcoming spell resistance.<br /><br /><strong> Bitter Armament (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, metal weapons wielded by a Lantern Bearer are treated as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (in addition to the weapons&rsquo; other special material properties). These weapons, including fired ammunition, retain this property for 1 round after leaving the Lantern Bearer&rsquo;s grasp.<br /><br /><strong> Favored Enemy (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Lantern Bearer selects a creature type from the following: aberration, animal, fey, humanoid (elf ), outsider (evil), and plant. This ability functions like the ranger class ability of the same name, and Lantern Bearer levels stack with other class levels that grant the favored enemy ability.<br /><br />At 8th level, the Lantern Bearer can select an additional favored enemy from this list. In addition, the bonus against any one favored enemy from this list (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.<br /><br /><strong> Superior Discernment (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Lantern Bearer gains one of the following as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites: Eagle Eyes<sup>APG</sup>, Elven Accuracy<sup>APG</sup>, or Sharp Senses<sup>APG</sup>.<br /><br /><strong> Unbounded Stride (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, as a swift action, a Lantern Bearer can make herself immune to effects that would impede her movement, such as overgrown foliage, solid fog, webs, or other magical area effects that impair movement or confer the entangled condition. This ability is similar in effect to a druid&rsquo;s woodland stride ability, but its benefits extend to magical effects as well. She takes no damage from moving through spiky vegetation, briars, or even a wall of thorns, but harmful gases and other detrimental effects, such as fire damage from an <em>incendiary cloud</em>, still affect her as normal. A Lantern Bearer can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level; these rounds need not be consecutive.<br /><br /><strong> Proven Weapon Familiarity (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a Lantern Bearer gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with composite longbows, composite shortbows, longbows, longswords, rapiers, shortbows, short swords, and any weapon with &ldquo;elven&rdquo; in its name.<br /><br /><strong> Celestial Weaponry (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a Lantern Bearer&rsquo;s attacks are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br /><br /><strong> Fade from Sight (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a Lantern Bearer can use the Stealth skill without having anything to hide behind, and even while being observed. Activating this ability is a swift action in addition to the action required to hide. A Lantern Bearer can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level; these rounds need not be consecutive.<br /><br /><strong> Aiudara Alignment (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, once per day as a fullround action, a Lantern Bearer can use the interconnected power of the aiudara (a series of magical portals sometimes called &ldquo;elf gates&rdquo;) to teleport herself to an elf gate that she has studied carefully (as per the spell <em>teleport</em>). This functions as <em>word of recall</em>, but the Lantern Bearer can transport only herself plus 50 pounds of objects.<br /><br />In addition, a Lantern Bearer can magically slip between the spaces in reality twice per day as a swift action, as if using <em>dimension door</em>.

This ability stacks with any trap sense bonuses that are gained from other classes.<br /><br /><strong> Trapfinding (Ex)</strong>: This ability functions as per the rogue class feature. Levels in Aspis agent stack with levels from any other class that grants this ability for the purposes of determining an Aspis agent&rsquo;s total trapfinding bonus.<br /><br /><strong> Agency Secrets</strong>: At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an Aspis agent gains one of the following agency secrets. An Aspis agent can&rsquo;t select an individual agency secret more than once (unless otherwise stated in the secret&rsquo;s text).<br /><br /><em> Bluster (Ex)</em>: The Aspis agent takes no penalty on Intimidate checks against larger creatures, and larger creatures gain no bonus on Intimidate checks against her.<br /><br /><em> Bonus Feat</em>:: The Aspis agent can choose one of the following as a bonus feat: Advanced Ranger Trap<sup>UM</sup>, Antagonize<sup>UM</sup>, Combat Expertise, Enforcer<sup>APG</sup>, Greater Dirty Trick<sup>APG</sup>, Improved Dirty Trick<sup>APG</sup>, Improved Whip Mastery<sup>UC</sup>, Intimidating Prowess, Learn Ranger Trap<sup>UM</sup>, Skill Focus (Intimidate), or Whip Mastery<sup>UC</sup>. She must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat. An Aspis agent can select this agency secret twice.<br /><br /><em> Conceal Thoughts (Su)</em>: The Aspis agent who is targeted with <em>detect thoughts</em> or a similar effect can choose what thoughts are actually detected, while her true thoughts remain private. This does not affect mind-affecting effects other than thought-reading.<br /><br /><em> Exotic Performance</em>: The Aspis agent with the bardic performance or the versatile performance class feature increases her effective bard level by 1 for all effects related to performances, including learning new types of performances and increasing the effects of her performances.<br /><br /><em> Hidden Stash (Ex/Sp)</em>: The Aspis agent gains a bonus equal to her class level on Sleight of Hand checks to hide small objects on her person. In addition, once per day she can hide the magical properties of one item as per <em>magic aura</em>.<br /><br /><em> Master Caster</em>: The Aspis agent who can cast spells as a bard, inquisitor, or mesmerist increases her caster level for that class by 1. She does not gain other benefits of that class other than spells per day, spells known, and an increased caster level. If the agent has levels in more than one of these classes, she must choose which class to apply this increase to when she takes this agency secret. An Aspis agent can select this agency secret twice.<br /><br /><em> Rogue Talent</em>: The Aspis agent can select one rogue talent for which she qualifies. Her Aspis agent levels stack with class levels for any rogue talents she has with level-dependent effects, whether they were gained from this prestige class or another class. An Aspis agent with at least 1 level in a class that grants access to rogue talents can select this agency secret twice.<br /><br /><em> Shrunken Smuggle (Sp)</em>: The Aspis agent can cast <em>shrink item</em> once per day as a spell-like ability, using her class level as her caster level. In addition, while the item is shrunken, it is also affected as per <em>nondetection</em>. This effect ends when the item returns to its proper size.<br /><br /><em> Vigilante Agent (Ex)</em>: The Aspis agent with vigilante class levels can select one social talent for which she qualifies. If she can gain vigilante talents from her vigilante class levels, she can instead select one vigilante talent for which she qualifies. Her Aspis agent levels stack with her vigilante class levels for any such talents she has with level-dependent effects, whether they were gained with this prestige class or another class. An Aspis agent with at least 1 vigilante level can select this agency secret twice.<br /><br /><strong> Mask Alignment (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, as a standard action, an Aspis agent can alter her alignment aura to deceive effects that detect alignment. She can emulate a different aura of her choice or to radiate no alignment aura. This affects only alignment detection, not effects that cause harm or are otherwise based on alignment. This effect lasts until she dismisses it or changes her alignment aura again.<br /><br />At 6th level, an Aspis agent targeted with an effect that detects alignment or with any alignment-based effect can automatically identify the effect by attempting a Spellcraft check. If successful, she can mask her alignment as an immediate action.<br /><br />At 10th level, when an Aspis agent assumes a false alignment aura, she is treated as having that alignment for all effects of magic items, spells, and spell-like or supernatural effects (such as <em>forbiddance</em>, <em>sympathy</em>, or an <em>unholy</em> weapon), including magical traps based on alignment. While masking her alignment, she ignores these types of effects that relate to her true alignment.<br /><br /><strong> Ambush Trap (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an Aspis agent can specially rig a mechanical trap she has either crafted or bypassed by exceeding its Disable Device DC by 10. A trap so rigged can be triggered by the Aspis agent as a move action as long as she is adjacent to the trap. She adds her trap sense bonus to the trap&rsquo;s Perception DC and to the trap&rsquo;s attack rolls, and adds her sneak attack damage to the damage the trap deals to affected creatures that are flat-footed or otherwise denied their Dexterity bonus to AC.<br /><br /><strong> Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an Aspis agent gains sneak attack as per the rogue ability. Initially, the extra damage dealt is 1d6, and it increases by 1d6 at 6th level and at 9th level. If an Aspis agent gains a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.<br /><br /><strong> Crucial Taunt (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, an Aspis agent can combine smugness and mockery with Bluff checks to feint, Intimidate checks to demoralize, and dirty trick combat maneuver checks (<em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide</em> 320), gaining a bonus equal to half her class level on these checks. She can then delay the effect of the successful check for up to 1 day per class level, spending an immediate action to trigger it later. The Aspis agent must be within 60 feet of her target to use or trigger a crucial taunt. This is a language-dependent effect.<br /><br /><strong> Improved Trap Sense (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, an Aspis agent&rsquo;s trap sense bonus applies to saving throws to avoid trap effects.<br /><br /><strong> Remote Activation (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, an Aspis agent can use her ambush trap ability on a trap up to 30 feet away.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ZBLJDlr8YK8zuo9I","dataType":"compendium","name":"Agency Secrets","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LKzceAsoRx8DdAo9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ambush Trap (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.J2xNgt1EMKsxPYiO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Crucial Taunt (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tOgP5ciXazhHbnPc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Trapfinding (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LE8CZLZpCshkLYkN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mask Alignment (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.r76NaTaLbuI3a8S7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Remote Activation (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":8,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.F0gVj5U4LMvNfXwX","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KpZwiUnU0VKymgmL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Trap Sense (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":1,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QB6dOoAsQg9XKdbY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Trap Sense (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-sealed-brown-red.webp","level":7,"_index":8}]},"tag":"aspisAgent","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Aspis Agent","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They also fight against the schemes of all undead creatures and any plots to increase the power of undeath, especially those associated with the Whispering Way.<br /><br />The order is deeply religious, composed of devoted worshipers of their current patron deity, Iomedae. At the height of the Shining Crusade, the Knights of Ozem venerated Aroden and summoned Arazni, demigod and warrior-herald of Aroden, to aid them in their battle against the Whispering Tyrant. Arazni&rsquo;s death at Tar- Baphon&rsquo;s hands and the demise of Aroden at the start of the Age of Lost Omens caused the order to transfer its allegiance to Aroden&rsquo;s inheritor&mdash;the goddess Iomedae, herself a heroine of the Shining Crusade. The Knights of Ozem hold a particular grudge against the ghostly wizardruler Geb, who stole Arazni&rsquo;s corpse and reanimated her as a lich, taking her as his Harlot Queen. They pursue Arazni in her new form, in hopes of destroying her and giving her soul eternal rest.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Knight of Ozem, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Armor Proficiency</strong>: Must be proficient with heavy armor and shields (not including tower shields).<br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Must worship Iomedae.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks.<br /><strong>Weapon Proficiency</strong>: Must be proficient with the longsword.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Knight of Ozem's class skills are Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Sentinel against undeath</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Teamwork feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Aegis feat, favored enemy (undead)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Thwart foul magic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Teamwork feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Aegis feat, blessed conviction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Purge malevolence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Teamwork feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Aegis feat, foil deathcaster</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.65133%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9091%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.4097%;\">Raiment of righteousness</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Knight of Ozem prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A Knight of Ozem gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Sentinel Against Undeath (Ex)</strong>: A Knight of Ozem gains a bonus equal to 1/3 his class level (minimum +1) on Perception and Sense Motive checks against undead. He also gains this bonus as a dodge bonus to his AC and CMD against attacks made by undead.<br /><br /><strong>Teamwork Feat (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, and every three levels thereafter, a Knight of Ozem gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as teamwork feats. The Knight of Ozem must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.<br /><br />In addition, at these levels, a Knight of Ozem may choose to learn a new teamwork feat in place of a teamwork feat he has already learned. In effect, he loses the old teamwork feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability, and he can change only one teamwork feat at any given level.<br /><br /><strong>Aegis Feat (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a Knight of Ozem gains a bonus feat from the following list: Bashing Finish<sup>APG</sup>, Covering Defense<sup>APG</sup>, Greater Shield Focus, Greater Shield Specialization<sup>APG</sup>, Improved Shield Bash, Missile Shield<sup>APG</sup>, Ray Shield<sup>APG</sup>, Saving Shield<sup>APG</sup>, Shield Focus, Shield Master, Shield Slam, Shield Specialization<sup>APG</sup>. A Knight of Ozem must meet the prerequisites for these feats, but his class levels count as fighter levels for the purposes of meeting these prerequisites.<br /><br /><strong>Favored Enemy (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Knight of Ozem gains a favored enemy bonus of +2 against undead, or if the Knight of Ozem already has favored enemy (undead) from another class, increases his existing bonus by +2. (This doesn&rsquo;t increase existing favored enemy bonuses against any other creature types.) This otherwise functions as the ranger class ability.<br /><br /><strong>Thwart Foul Magic (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a Knight of Ozem threatens an undead spellcaster, he gains the benefits of the Disruptive and Spellbreaker feats. He counts as having these feats for the purposes of qualifying for feats or other abilities. If he already possesses the Disruptive and/or Spellbreaker feats, the effects do not stack. When he threatens any spellcaster (not just an undead spellcaster), the concentration check DC increases by 2 if the spell being cast is from the necromancy school, has the death descriptor, or has the evil descriptor. For the purpose of this ability, the Knight of Ozem counts as having automatically identified the effect as if he had made a Spellcraft check. This increase only applies if the Knight of Ozem is aware of the spellcaster&rsquo;s location and is capable of making an attack of opportunity.<br /><br /><strong>Blessed Conviction (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a Knight of Ozem gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against spells and effects created by undead creatures.<br /><br /><strong>Purge Malevolence (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a Knight of Ozem can attempt to dispel an ongoing spell effect from the necromancy school or one with the death or evil descriptor as part of a melee attack against a creature or object. The Knight of Ozem must declare the attempt before making the attack, and if he misses, the attempt is wasted. If the attack hits, eligible effects on the target are subject to a targeted <em>dispel magic</em> effect (caster level equal to the Knight of Ozem&rsquo;s total character level). He can use this ability on any melee attack, but only once per round.<br /><br /><strong>Foil Deathcaster (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, once per day as an immediate action, a Knight of Ozem can force an undead spellcaster he threatens to reroll a concentration check made to cast defensively. The spellcaster must take the lower result.<br /><br /><strong>Raiment of Righteousness (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, once per day as a standard action, a Knight of Ozem can transfigure his gear into the Iomedaean embodiment of virtuous valor. His armor (if metallic) turns silver-gray, gaining the material properties of adamantine in addition to any other material properties it may have. His shield (if he wears one) glows like a torch and gains the <em>blinding</em> special ability in addition to any other special abilities it has. The shield&rsquo;s <em>blinding </em>ability has a saving throw DC of 19 (21 vs. undead). His cloak (if he wears one) turns bright red, becoming a <em>cloak of resistance +5 </em>in addition to any other properties it has. His sword (if he wields one) acts as if it has a <em>holy sword </em>spell cast upon it with caster level equal to his class level. These effects last for 1 minute, and only function while the Knight of Ozem wields or wears these items. A dropped or removed item ceases granting its abilities, but resumes if returned before the duration expires.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.RSbcOsL7UGxOXNzt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Thwart Foul Magic (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":4,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lgvfYaaxUrDZGb9x","dataType":"compendium","name":"Teamwork Feat (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6CHJimF4XCLdd2j2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sentinel Against Undeath (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PMFnTOwlwAXBKSIq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Raiment of Righteousness (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":10,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IOTPOKGmLj15zjRX","dataType":"compendium","name":"Purge Malevolence (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":7,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eIWAun1ddKRaRU8p","dataType":"compendium","name":"Foil Deathcaster (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":9,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YcY1TVqid51OaeEG","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favored Enemy (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Rby6hVRn8hpm69ba","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blessed Conviction (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":6,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YpHVK9tMc017wcbp","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aegis Feat (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-wooden-sword-green.webp","level":3,"_index":8}]},"tag":"knightOfOzem","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Even more significant than any cosmetic changes, the stresses on a bloatmage&rsquo;s body can prove dangerous to both them and those around them, for if the cephalic pressure on a bloatmage&rsquo;s brain becomes too great, she f lies into a murderous rage before falling unconscious and quickly bleeding out. Such obvious drawbacks keep most from walking the path of the bloated ascetics, but the bloatmages dismiss those detractors who lack the courage to follow in their footsteps, noting that in the pursuit of power and self-perfection, all other concerns are secondary.<br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Bloatmages are consummate spellcasters, often operating as heavy artillery in battle, but their potential to run amok when strained can make them nearly as dangerous to their friends as to their enemies.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Bloatmages have no particular alignment, but their single-minded focus on the goal of attaining greater magical ability (and the general public&rsquo;s prurient abhorrence of their ritualistic self-mutilation) tends to make them at least partially neutral.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a bloatmage, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Feats</strong>:

of the following are class features of the bloatmage prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Bloatmages gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known</strong>: When a new bloatmage level is gained, the character gains new spells as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a bloatmage, she must decide which class she adds the new level to for the purpose of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Blood Pool</strong>: At 1st level, a bloatmage gains a pool of blood points, representing an overload of her system with excess blood to extend her arcane abilities beyond their normal level. A bloatmage&rsquo;s normal pool of blood points is equal to her bloatmage level. Blood points can be spent at the time of casting to cast a spell without using that spell&rsquo;s spell slot. The spell slot remains unused (for spontaneous casters), or the spell is recalled as if it had not been cast (for spellcasters who prepare spells). Retaining a spell or spell slot in this manner costs a number of blood points equal to the spell&rsquo;s level, and these points must be spent at the time of casting. Blood points do not give spellcasters access to spells they don&rsquo;t already know or have prepared.<br /><br />In addition, the bloatmage may push herself via her bloat ability in order to gain a number of extra blood points, but such exertion is a dangerous gamble. If the bloatmage&rsquo;s current number of blood points is greater than her class level but less than or equal to twice her class level, she gains the sickened condition. If her exertions push her beyond twice her normal blood point level, she immediately flies into a homicidal rage, striking out randomly with her most damaging attacks and abilities at friends and foes alike for 1d6 rounds or until her blood pool is reduced to 0 (whichever comes first). At the end of the rage, her blood points drop to 0, her hit points drop to &ndash;1, and she begins dying.<br /><br />Each day, when the bloatmage rests to regain spells, she regains blood points up to her class level but not beyond (so if her bloatmage level is 5 but she currently has 8 points, she remains at 8 until she spends the extra points).<br /><br />Some bloatmages conduct constant rituals involving leeches or exsanguination in an attempt to regulate their systems. These rituals, which must be undertaken daily during spell preparation, give the bloatmage the option of subtracting 1 point from any bloating rolls (see below) after the results are known, but at the price of a non-cumulative &ndash;2 penalty to Constitution. This penalty cannot be removed, save by the bloatmage abandoning the rituals for a day (also during spell preparation), which removes it immediately.<br /><br /><strong>Bloat</strong>: A bloatmage can exert herself as a free action to instantly gain extra blood points, but doing so puts her at risk of a dangerous collapse. At 1st level, the bloatmage can bloat once per day to gain 1d4 points. At 4th, she can bloat twice per day, and the die roll becomes 1d8. At 8th, she can bloat three times per day, and the roll becomes 1d12.<br /><br /><strong>Hemophilia</strong>: Bloatmages are particularly susceptible to bleed effects, and the DC of any Heal check made to stop a bleed effect is 5 higher than normal. In addition, anytime a bleeding wound is inflicted on a bloatmage, she loses 1 blood point. This loss of blood points is cumulative for multiple bleed attacks, but not each time she takes damage from the same attack.<br /><br /><strong>Corpulence</strong>: At 3rd level, a bloatmage becomes so massive that her rolls of fatty, blood-laden flesh grant her a +1 natural armor bonus. At 7th level, this bonus increases to +2 but reduces her speed by 10 feet. This penalty stacks with the penalty from the Bloatmage Initiate feat. This reduction in speed can never reduce the bloatmage&rsquo;s speed below 5 feet, nor does it affect magical flying effects.<br /><br /><strong>Absorb Bloodline</strong>: At 10th level, a bloatmage can temporarily access all of the bloodline powers of a given sorcerer bloodline as if she were a sorcerer of a level equaling her total arcane spellcaster level (including bloatmage levels) by consuming blood tied to that bloodline. By drinking 1 pint of fresh blood (which inflicts 1 point of Constitution damage) from a sorcerer with the given bloodline or from a creature aff iliated with that bloodline, the bloatmage gains the ability to use the bloodline powers (but not bonus spells, proficiencies, and so on) as appropriate to her level for 1 hour. This ability is usable once per day and drinking the blood normally requires a full minute, but bloatmages with the Brew Potion feat can distill the blood into a potion-sized draught that can be stored and consumed as a standard action.<br /><br />Any bloodlines absorbed are in addition to the original bloodline of a bloatmage with sorcerer levels. Though the bloatmage gains no physical nourishment from drinking blood, this practice is likely responsible for many of the stories linking bloatmages and vampires.<br /><br />In addition to sorcerers of the given bloodline, the following list presents a few examples of creatures whose blood is considered affiliated to a bloodline.

The hinterlands comprise the farmlands and woodland villages of Golarion, a liminal space between humanity and the wild. Some of the rugged men and women who defend these pockets of civilization are the hinterlanders. Hinterlanders are followers of Erastil who shield rural folk from dangerous creatures, extraplanar interlopers, and marauding undead. A hinterlander is skilled with a bow and in tune with the wild, yet capable of harnessing natural resources to nourish mortal communities. They are often touched by the divine, sworn to guard the borders of towns and villages against the forces that threaten to snuff out the hearth fires.</span></p>\n<h2

proficient with all simple weapons, longbows, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).<br /><br /><strong>Favored Enemy (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a hinterlander chooses a favored enemy from the list below. This functions like the ranger class feature of the same name, except that the hinterlander gains an additional ability corresponding with the favored enemy chosen. Additionally, at 8th level, he can select a new favored enemy and the bonus for one such enemy increases by 2 (rather than at 5th and 10th levels).<br /><br /><em>Aberrations</em>: The hinterlander gains a +2 bonus on all saves against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used by aberrations.<br /><br /><em>Constructs</em>: The hinterlander&rsquo;s ranged attacks ignore the first 10 points of a construct&rsquo;s DR or hardness.<br /><br /><em>Evil Outsiders</em>: The hinterlander&rsquo;s ranged attacks are treated as good weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.<br /><br /><em>Magical Beasts</em>: The hinterlander can improve the attitude of a magical beast regardless of its Intelligence score. This ability functions like wild empathy, except the hinterlander takes no penalty for attempting this check.<br /><br /><em>Monstrous Humanoids</em>: The hinterlander gains a +2 bonus on all saves against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used by monstrous humanoids.<br /><br /><em>Undead</em>: Arrows loosed from a hinterlander&rsquo;s bow are infused with divine power and deal full damage to any undead that are incorporeal, as if the arrows had the <em>ghost touch </em>weapon special ability.<br /><br /><strong>Master Archer (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, and again at 3rd and 5th levels, a hinterlander gains a bonus feat from the following list, even if he doesn&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites: Erastil&rsquo;s Blessing, Far Shot, Focused Shot, Point-Blank Shot, and Rapid Shot. At 3rd level, he adds Improved Precise Shot, Parting Shot, Point-Blank Master, and Manyshot to the list. At 5th level, he adds Pinpoint Targeting and Shot on the Run to the list. The benefits of these feats apply only when the hinterlander wears light, medium, or no armor.<br /><br /><strong>Fast Movement (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a hinterlander&rsquo;s base land speed increases by 10 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Favored Terrain (Hinterland) (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, when a hinterlander is within a 10-mile radius of a settlement with a population of 2,000 or fewer individuals, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. A hinterlander traveling through this terrain leaves no trail and can&rsquo;t be tracked (although he can leave a trail if he so desires). At 9th level, these initiative and skill bonuses increase to +4, and the bonuses function as long as the hinterlander is within 20 miles of a settlement with a population of 2,000 or fewer.<br /><br /><strong>Hinterland Stride (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a hinterlander moves with ease through natural and agrarian environments. This functions exactly like woodland stride, except that a hinterlander also moves normally through any nonmagical difficult terrain in settled areas with a population of 2,000 or less individuals, such as a farm or village. <br /><br /><strong>Chosen Kin (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, as a standard action, a hinterlander can designate a number of allies up to 3 + his Wisdom modifier to be his chosen kin. Allies so designated gain half the hinterlander&rsquo;s favored terrain (hinterland) bonus and half of the bonuses granted by defended hearth (see below). Members of his chosen kin must remain within 30 feet of the hinterlander in order to gain these benefits. At 7th level, this range increases to 60 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Defended Hearth (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a hinterlander can designate a settlement as a defended hearth, allowing him to sense the presence of unnatural creatures within 5 miles of it. Aberrations, constructs, dragons, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, outsiders, and undead constitute unnatural presences for this purpose. Though the hinterlander is aware of potential danger, he doesn&rsquo;t know the exact nature or location of the creature unless he can perceive it.<br /><br />The defended hearth must be a settled area with a population of 2,000 or fewer individuals, and the hinterlander must spend 24 hours carefully studying the entire area to activate this ability, after which he gains a +2 favored terrain bonus in that settlement, which stacks with any other favored terrain bonus he receives in that area. This bonus increases to +4 at 10th level. A hinterlander can have a number of defended hearths equal to his Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). When he reaches his maximum number of defended hearths, he can select a new defended hearth by abandoning an existing one and performing the ritual for a new area.<br /><br /><strong>Imbue Arrow (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a hinterlander gains the ability to place a spell that affects an area upon an arrow. This functions exactly like the arcane archer ability of the same name.<br /><br /><strong>Waymarker Travel (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, a hinterlander gains the ability to create a waymarker anywhere within the area of a defended hearth. The hinterlander can maintain up to five waymarkers at a time&mdash;if the hinterlander creates a sixth waymarker, he chooses which of the previous five deactivates. Once per day as a move action, the hinterlander can cast <em>word of recall</em> as a spell-like ability to teleport to any of his active waymarkers.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AIhx28I9c7ShGitx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Chosen Kin (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":4,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fCCcGM0F5IrpPySi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Defended Hearth (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":6,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LFz3gBilQubfmgqT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Fast Movement (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tRF0m0XTwkYquQhx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favored Enemy (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.jOwHfnBNsAw5x8sb","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favored Terrain (Hinterland) (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.K8QEJANuqqzxXV9D","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hinterland Stride (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6COo6NqBrZyidjK2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Imbue Arrow (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":7,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.BwIqxewYpWuKM4ui","dataType":"compendium","name":"Waymarker Travel (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":10,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cfvZWJNLUKuG8tVB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master Archer Bonus Feat (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/tree-spruce.webp","level":3,"_index":8}]},"tag":"hinterlander","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":"longbows"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Others are born with what the Varisians call &ldquo;birth tattoos&rdquo;&mdash;incredibly elaborate and colorful birthmarks; those so blessed almost always grow up to become tattooed mystics.

gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Familiar Tattoo (Su)</strong>: This ability is exactly like the tattooed sorcerer ability of the same name (<em>Inner Sea Magic </em>40). <br /><br /><strong>Mystic Tattoo (Su)</strong>: A tattooed mystic inscribes ancient symbols of power on his skin to enhance his spellcasting. At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, the mystic inscribes a new tattoo on his body, chosen from the list below. Mystic tattoos do not occupy magic item or tattoo slots on his body. The mystic can select each tattoo more than once; the effects of multiple tattoos are noted in their descriptions.<br /><br /><em>Binding Trine</em>: This triangular design allows the mystic to transform a hostile spell affecting him into a magical tattoo, similar to a<em> reservoir tattoo </em>(<em>Inner Sea Magic </em>16). When the mystic fails a saving throw against a spell of 3rd level or lower that targets only him, he gets a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If he succeeds at this check, he can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level as an immediate action to bind the spell, suppressing its effects and suspending its duration for a number of rounds equal to his level. Only spells with a duration longer than instantaneous can be bound this way, and only one spell can be held at a time. While bound, the spell can be dispelled or removed as normal. The maximum spell level this tattoo can bind increases by 2 each time it&rsquo;s selected, to a maximum of 9th level.<br /><br /><em>Blistering Bands</em>: These glowing, angular markings encircle the mystic&rsquo;s arms. Whenever the mystic casts an evocation spell that deals energy damage, he can spend a swift action to surround himself with an aura of that same energy until the beginning of his next turn. Creatures adjacent to the mystic when he activates the ability or that end their turns adjacent to him take 1d6 points of damage of the same energy type as the evocation spell. If the spell deals more than one type of energy damage, the mystic must choose which of those types of damage his aura deals. Selecting this tattoo additional times increases the damage dealt by 2d6, to a maximum of 7d6.<br /><br /><em>Flickering Eye</em>: The skin beneath this stylized eye seems partially translucent and insubstantial. When the mystic spends a standard action to concentrate on an ongoing illusion effect created by one of his spells, he gains concealment (20% miss chance) until the beginning of his next turn. Effects that negate invisibility negate this miss chance. When this tattoo is chosen a second time, the miss chance increases to 50%. When it&rsquo;s chosen a third time, the mystic instead becomes invisible, as per the spell invisibility, until the beginning of his next turn.<br /><br /><em>Pouncing Beasts</em>: These bestial pictographs seem poised to leap off the mystic&rsquo;s skin. The mystic can cast <em>summon monster </em>and <em>summon nature&rsquo;s ally </em>spells of up to 3rd level as a standard action, rather than a full-round action, provided all the creatures summoned enter play adjacent to him. The maximum spell level the tattoo can affect increases by 2 each time it&rsquo;s selected, to a maximum of 9th level.<br /><br /><em>Rune of Fangs</em>: These jagged runes cover the mystic&rsquo;s face, giving him a bestial expression. While polymorphed or otherwise transformed into a form with natural attacks, the mystic gains an enhancement bonus on his attack and damage rolls equal to 1/2 his level with one natural attack, chosen when he assumes that form. Each time he selects this tattoo, he can choose one additional natural attack to apply the bonus to.<br /><br /><em>Swallowing Glyph</em>: This ornate, shadowy glyph absorbs the souls of those the mystic slays. Any time the mystic slays a creature with a necromancy spell, he can spend a swift action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell&rsquo;s level. Temporary hit points gained from subsequent uses of this ability do not stack. The second time this tattoo is selected, the number of temporary hit points increases to double the spell&rsquo;s level. The third time it&rsquo;s selected, the number increases to triple the spell&rsquo;s level.<br /><br /><em>Twisting Script</em>: The indistinct shapes that form this spiral tattoo twist into legible text when scrutinized. Creatures within 30 feet of the mystic that can see him are affected by his language-dependent enchantment spells, even if they do not understand the language he speaks. Creatures without a language are immune to this effect. The range of the effect increases by 30 feet each time this tattoo is selected, to a maximum of 150 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Magical Tattoo Artist</strong>: At 3rd level, a tattooed mystic gains Inscribe Magical Tattoo (<em>Inner Sea Magic </em>16) as a bonus feat.<br /><br /><strong>Skillful Tattooist (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, as long as a tattooed mystic is using his Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos) skill to craft magical tattoos on his own body, he can do so in half the time it would normally take (see page 91 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>).<br /><br /><strong>Tattoo Mastery (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a tattooed mystic can use his own ability score modifier and relevant feats to set the DC for <em>spell tattoos </em>he crafts, and can use his own caster level if it is higher than that of the <em>spell tattoo </em>he is crafting (similar to a caster using a staff ).<br /><br /><strong>Potent Tattoos (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, when a tattooed mystic uses his caster level to determine the DC of one the <em>spell tattoos </em>he has crafted, he does so at +1 caster level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ozvMlYCEEvAITMon","dataType":"compendium","name":"Familiar Tattoo (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_20.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8bUVuDQFXfuM0NTo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Magical Tattoo Artist","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_20.jpg","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MJShF8DIaDehk8VN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mystic Tattoo (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_20.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FiBo6MjOS7c3WJzu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Potent Tattoos (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_20.jpg","level":9,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fzhtO4LCfaG4Rdqo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Skillful Tattooist (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_20.jpg","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2053WAagTzZDCFOu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tattoo Mastery (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_20.jpg","level":7,"_index":5}]},"tag":"tattooedMystic","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

When using <em>detect magic </em>(or spells that function as <em>detect magic</em>, such as <em>arcane sight</em>), the detective treats recently ended magical effects as though they were one category stronger when determining how long a lingering aura remains, and by concentrating for an additional round can determine exactly how long the lingering aura has been there (effectively allowing the Sleepless detective to learn when the spell or magic item that caused the aura was cast or destroyed, respectively).<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 for every three levels beyond the first. If a Sleepless detective gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.<br /><br /><strong>Follow Clues (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Sleepless detective can use Perception to follow tracks as per the Survival skill, as though she possessed the follow clues rogue talent (<em>Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide </em>130). If the detective already has this ability from another class, she can move at her normal speed while tracking with the Perception skill without taking the usual &ndash;5 penalty on her Perception checks.<br /><br /><strong>Deductive Examination (Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, the Sleepless detective can use the spell <em>residual tracking</em><sup>APG</sup> three times per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to her class level).<br /><br /><strong>Eye for Detail (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a Sleepless detective&rsquo;s keen eye for detail helps her notice hidden traps, doors, and clues. The detective is entitled to an immediate Perception check to notice such features whenever she passes within 10 feet of them, whether or not she is actively looking. This check should be made in secret by the GM. If the detective would already receive such a check because of an ability from some other source (such as the trap spotter rogue talent), the GM should roll the Perception check twice whenever the Sleepless detective is within 10 feet of a trap and use the higher result.<br /><br /><strong>Hematomancy (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, a Sleepless detective learns to extract information from blood and other bodily f luids through extensive alchemical analysis. The detective can use the spell <em>blood biography</em><sup>APG</sup> three times per day (caster level equal to her class level). When using this ability, any type of bodily f luid or part of a creature&rsquo;s body will suffice in place of blood.<br /><br /><strong>Thoughtful Reexamining (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a Sleepless detective can reach new conclusions by reexamining the facts of her investigation. This functions as the advanced rogue talent of the same name (<em>Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide </em>132). If the detective has the thoughtful reexamining ability from another class, she can use the ability one additional time per day.<br /><br /><strong>Discern Lies (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, a Sleepless detective can use <em>discern lies</em>, as the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level (caster level equal to her class level). These rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.<br /><br /><strong>Predictive Riposte (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, a Sleepless detective&rsquo;s insight into human nature allows her to predict and counter her opponents&rsquo; attacks. As a standard action, she can designate an opponent within 30 feet as the target of her predictive riposte, gaining a +4 insight bonus to AC against that opponent&rsquo;s attacks. Once per round, after a melee attack from the designated target misses her, the detective can spend an immediate action to make a single melee attack against that opponent as long as it is within her threatened area. This counts as her attack of opportunity for this round. If the detective&rsquo;s attack hits, she may add her sneak attack bonus on her damage roll. The bonuses from this ability last until the end of combat, or until the detective designates a new target of her predictive riposte.<br /><br /><strong>Pierce Deception (Sp)</strong>: At 9th level, a Sleepless detective can see as though under the effect of the spell <em>true seeing </em>for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level (caster level equal to her class level). These rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is a free action.<br /><br /><strong>Reconstruction (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, once per day a Sleepless detective can combine her investigative insight with her magical senses to mentally reconstruct the recent history of an item or place. The detective must be able to examine the item or area for 10 minutes, after which she can view the events of the past 24 hours as though she had a scrying sensor present when those events took place. This ability shows her any events which took place within 60 feet of the examined area, or any creature or object that physically touched the item or area in question. Her vision is not obstructed by concealment, and she can see and identify magical auras as though under the effect of <em>arcane sight</em>. A reconstruction shows creatures and objects as they actually are, unobscured by even powerful illusion magic such as <em>screen</em>, though transmuted creatures and objects appear in their altered forms.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.JQZ7clfXsFKEwTl5","dataType":"compendium","name":"Canny Sleuth (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TLFiwIpn9Aogn7QT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deductive Examination (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.r2kjS9fJTI9gbmlF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Follow Clues (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EE0cYrzPcCFoZbuC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Forensic Thaumaturgy (Su)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WCLjLkw2CREssenw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hematomancy (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oWEDOuSLfiScnyU3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Pierce Deception (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":9,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mbAS6gYfksKP0noW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Predictive Riposte (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":8,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ZsIiv91DyQPG6wws","dataType":"compendium","name":"Reconstruction (Su)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":10,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.606xRMpiOK1ifimx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Thoughtful Reexamining (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":6,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IODCf9vRjDVCFHLc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":1,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.C3dz5e6GgBkNTYuN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eye for Detail (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":4,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.R7Byu97rL8jPeqaz","dataType":"compendium","name":"Discern Lies (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/magnifying-glass.webp","level":7,"_index":11}]},"tag":"sleeplessDetective","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":true,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

For centuries, this portal has been safeguarded by an order of monks known as the Brothers of the Seal, ensuring that none disturbed the mighty vault and unleashed what powers lay locked within. With the passage of time, however, the truth of what the seal hid was lost even to its guardians. As secret-keepers disappeared and records were lost, the Brothers of the Seal maintained their vigil but began to wonder what they guarded, and for whom, and realized that no one truly knew the answers anymore.<br /><br />This realization and subsequent schism split the group into two factions. The Faithful believe they must keep the sacred trust of guardianship no matter who decreed it. The Scions, on the other hand, claim that promises to masters long gone need not be kept. Meanwhile, a marginalized third faction of the brotherhood has formed, composed of those who seek to unite their brethren once more.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Brother of the Seal, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any lawful.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Flurry of blows class feature.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Brother of the Seal's class skills are Disable Device (Dex), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Stealth (Dex).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Unarmed combat, water splitting stone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Gatekeeper, trapfinding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Runefinding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Awesome Blow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Unsealing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Domino strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Hands of stone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Rapid slam</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Cascading strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.3627%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.6443%;\">Unraveling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Brother of the Seal prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A Brother of the Seal gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Unarmed Combat (Ex)</strong>: A Brother of the Seal&rsquo;s class levels stack with any monk levels for the purposes of determining his flurry of blows, stunning fist, and unarmed strike class features (including determining damage dealt by his unarmed strike attacks).<br /><br /><strong>Water Splitting Stone (Ex)</strong>: When attacking an object, a Brother of the Seal ignores 1 point of hardness per class level.<br /><br /><strong>Gatekeeper (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Brother of the Seal may select either <em>hold portal </em>or <em>arcane lock</em>, and he gains the ability to cast the selected spell once per day. Once made, this choice cannot be reversed. At 6th level, and again at 10th level, a Brother of the Seal may cast the selected spell an additional time per day.<br /><br /><strong>Trapfinding (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Brother of the Seal adds 1/2 his class level on Perception and Disable Device checks made to find or disarm traps, and he can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.<br /><br /><strong>Runefinding (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Brother of the Seal&rsquo;s trapfinding bonus becomes equal to his level while dealing with magical glyphs, symbols, runes, and writings. In addition, he gains the trap spotter rogue talent, but it applies only to trapped magical writings.<br /><br /><strong>Awesome Blow (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a Brother of the Seal gains Awesome Blow (<em>Bestiary </em>314) as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites, adding his Wisdom modifier on awesome blow combat maneuver checks and dealing damage to his target equal to that dealt by his unarmed strike. Hardness ignored by the Brother of the Seal&rsquo;s water splitting stone ability applies when determining damage dealt to an obstacle while using an awesome blow combat maneuver.<br /><br />A Brother of the Seal can expend 1 <em>ki </em>point or one use of Stunning Fist in conjunction with this ability to affect a creature of his own size with an awesome blow, or 2 <em>ki</em> points or two uses of Stunning Fist to affect a creature one size larger. Using Stunning Fist or ki points in this fashion has no effect other than increasing the size of creature he can affect with his awesome blow.<br /><br />At 8th level, a Brother of the Seal can affect creatures up to his size with his Awesome Blow feat without expending a use of Stunning Fist or a <em>ki </em>point. In addition, he may affect a creature of any size larger than itself by spending 1 <em>ki </em>point or one use of Stunning Fist per size category of difference.<br /><br /><strong>Unsealing (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a Brother of the Seal can attempt to breach magical wards or protections, including abjurations, glyphs, runes, symbols, and other magical writings. He must touch the warded object, creature, or area&mdash;which can be done as part of an unarmed strike for normal damage or as a melee touch attack that deals no damage&mdash;and expend one use of Stunning Fist to dispel the effect (as <em>dispel magic</em>, caster level equal to his character level). If the unsealing is successful, the effect is destroyed and the Brother of the Seal suffers no harm from it, even if it normally harms those who touch it. If the unsealing fails, the Brother of the Seal suffers any normal effects for touching the warded area, object, or creature, and it remains intact unless it would normally be destroyed upon being interacted with.<br /><br /><strong>Domino Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, when a Brother of the Seal&rsquo;s awesome blow combat maneuver succeeds and knocks his target into an obstacle (including another creature), he adds his class level to the normal 1d6 points of damage taken by the target and the obstacle.<br /><br /><strong>Hands of Stone (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a Brother of the Seal increases his unarmed strike damage as though he were a creature one size larger.<br /><br /><strong>Rapid Slam (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, a Brother of the Seal can use his Awesome Blow feat once per round as part of a flurry of blows. Alternatively, he can make an awesome blow combat maneuver as part of a charge or as part of the same standard action he uses to perform another combat feat that involves an attack (such as Cleave or Vital Strike). He can still only make an awesome blow maneuver once per round regardless of how many attacks he makes.<br /><br /><strong>Cascading Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, when a Brother of the Seal&rsquo;s awesome blow maneuver succeeds and knocks the target into another creature of its size or smaller, the Brother of the Seal may attempt an awesome blow combat maneuver at a &ndash;2 penalty against this second creature. If successful, the Brother deals his unarmed strike damage to this second target (rather than the normal damage for striking an obstacle) and knocks that target back 10 feet. The Brother of the Seal can make additional awesome blow combat maneuvers each time a target strikes a creature behind it, with a cumulative &ndash;2 penalty for each additional target. All targets must be in a straight line. If a target is knocked simultaneously into several smaller creatures, the Brother can choose only one of them to affect with cascading strike.<br /><br /><strong>Unraveling (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Brother of the Seal&rsquo;s unsealing ability can destroy force effects and abjuration, conjuration, and evocation effects that create stationary barriers (such as <em>prismatic sphere</em>, <em>tiny hut</em>, or <em>wall of ice</em>), even if the effect cannot normally be subjected to <em>dispel magic</em>.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.s5hebJsLTbKGeSH2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Awesome Blow (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":4,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QLKF297AVzq8DKWo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Cascading Strike (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":9,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5Fm8KEENaulF69c2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Domino Strike (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":6,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FikCbPmdDOtJQxgE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Gatekeeper (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.XiBM3ikgMjUD9inv","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hands of Stone (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":7,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KFd8HrU4oytP2oZR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Rapid Slam (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":8,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rrVK10NncsIXozJH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Runefinding (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.m3Pkw4T28k30UPay","dataType":"compendium","name":"Trapfinding (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":2,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aXYkot3m88yt8xUQ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unarmed Combat (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":1,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.phNwtxnrQfw6UZMV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unraveling (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":10,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WSdnUqyApaffpbq1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unsealing (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":5,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hi9NA8vP30fJCciI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Water Splitting Stone (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/mech_5.jpg","level":1,"_index":11}]},"tag":"brotherOfTheSeal","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":true,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":true,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Brother of the Seal","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Yet in too many cases, these words are hollow falsehoods, for many of those who take up the sword to crusade in Iomedae&rsquo;s name do so for their own glory.<br /><br />After a time serving the crusades, some of these men and women attain such skill at serving the letter of the law while keeping to their own private agendas that they become low templars. Under a sanctified veneer, they walk a wavering line between heroism and thuggery. The church of Iomedae constantly struggles to maintain the morals of the crusaders, but when faced with the raw destruction of a demon host, sometimes the decision to support the lesser of two evils is the only real choice that can be made.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a low templar, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Mounted Combat, Weapon Focus (any martial weapon).<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Bluff 5 ranks, Knowledge (nobility or planes) 2 ranks, Ride 5 ranks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Low Templar's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Survival (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Crusader +1, flag of convenience</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Dirty fighting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Sneak attack +1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Crusader +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Live to fight another day, path of darkness/path of light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Ruthless</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Crusader +3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Sneak attack +2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Parting shot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2355%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Crusader +4, damnation/redemption</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are all class features of the low templar prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A low templar is proficient with all simple weapons and all martial weapons. He is proficient with all forms of armor and shields.<br /><br /><strong>Crusader (Ex)</strong>: Whatever his faults, a low templar is a skilled warrior against the demon hordes of the Worldwound. At 1st level, a low templar gains a +1 bonus on all weapon attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against chaotic evil outsiders. He also gains an equal bonus on all Will saving throws against the abilities of chaotic evil outsiders. At 4th level, these bonuses increase to +2. The bonus increases to +3 at 7th level, and finally to +4 at 10th level.<br /><br /><strong>Flag of Convenience (Ex)</strong>: A low templar is adept at aligning himself with the winning side and has mastered the art of shifting or switching allegiance when convenient. He can disappear in one place and appear in another with new affiliations and associations, yet without besmirching his reputation. Even when caught in illicit acts, he easily evades blame. The low templar gains a +2 bonus on all Bluff and Disguise checks, and on Linguistics checks made to create forgeries. A low templar never suffers a penalty to his Leadership score for moving around frequently, aloofness, cruelty, or the loss of prior cohorts or followers, and can replace lost followers in half the normal amount of time.<br /><br /><strong>Dirty Fighting (Ex)</strong>: A low templar melds the stately forms of jousting and chivalric standards with the downand- dirty style of a barroom brawler. No trick is beneath him. A low templar never takes a non-proficiency penalty on attack rolls with improvised weapons and gains a +2 bonus on all combat maneuver checks. In addition, whenever he lands a critical hit, the low templar may opt to deal normal damage and roll on the following table rather than dealing extra damage.</p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d6</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Target is staggered for 1 round</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Target is nauseated for 1 round</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Target is deafened for 1 round</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Target is blinded for 1 round</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Target is sickened for 1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Target becomes fatigued</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the critical multiplier is X3, the duration of the effect doubles. If the critical multiplier is X4, the duration triples.<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at 8th level. If a low templar gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.<br /><br /><strong>Path of Darkness/Path of Light (Su)</strong>: As a low templar advances, he must eventually decide how closely he wishes to hew to his oaths to Iomedae and her ethos of law and goodness. If he chooses the path of light, he may choose to ignore the lawful or good aspect of his alignment (choose one) for determining alignment-based magical effects (e.g., reducing damage from unholy blight or an unholy weapon, masking his alignment from detect good, or ignoring some effects of a magic circle against good). He also gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks with creatures with the lawful or good subtypes. If he chooses the path of darkness, he instead disregards either chaos or evil from his alignment and gains a Diplomacy bonus with creatures of the chaotic or evil subtypes.<br /><br /><strong>Live to Fight Another Day (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a low templar can use the withdraw action as a standard action, although if he does so, he can only move at his speed (not double his speed).<br /><br /><strong>Ruthless (Ex)</strong>: Whenever a low templar kills a foe or reduces it to a dying state with a melee attack, he can immediately make another attack with the same weapon at the same attack bonus as a swift action. This additional attack can be made on any legal target. The low templar gains a bonus on damage rolls with this swift action attack equal to his character level.<br /><br /><strong>Parting Shot (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a low templar can use the withdraw action as a move action, although if he does so, he can only move at his speed (not double his speed).<br /><br /><strong>Damnation/Redemption (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a low templar must make a final choice of which ethical path to follow. He may mask a second alignment trait versus alignment-based effects, as per the path of darkness/path of light ability. A low templar can choose the path of darkness at 5th level and then choose the path of redemption at 10th level (or vice versa). When the low templar makes his damnation/redemption choice, he gains a planar cohort appropriate to his actual alignment, gained as if he had taken the Leadership feat. This planar cohort appears to him and pledges her loyalty to the low templar immediately. If the cohort perishes, the low templar must wait a week before calling upon a replacement. If the low templar has the Leadership feat, he gains a +1 bonus to his Leadership score. If he replaces his cohort gained from the leadership feat with the planar cohort, the maximum level equivalent for his planar cohort equals the templar&rsquo;s class level &ndash;1, rather than &ndash;2.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.GzU6NwRwFMtMWaex","dataType":"compendium","name":"Crusader (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SqnjRLbrfDk4DyS7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Damnation - Redemption (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":10,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hoQt3MeCK99cFfhO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dirty Fighting (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rocL3E7pHuBbUHTZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Flag of Convenience (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.B86xWKuX3gA2ESr3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Live to Fight Another Day (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hYO9c3hriB1TZvzM","dataType":"compendium","name":"Parting Shot (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":9,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9N5fuIg0zB8SrwRh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Path of Darkness - Path of Light (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":5,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gccTXY701Hlgsw2w","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ruthless (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":6,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TcTRvrjaTpQk9TXV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/sword-guard-flanged.webp","level":3,"_index":8}]},"tag":"lowTemplar","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","hvy","shl","twr"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

A Red Mantis assassin can cast Red Mantis assassin spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure.<br /><br /><strong> Spells</strong>: A Red Mantis assassin casts illusion and transmutation arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer and wizard spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To cast a spell, she must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level, and her bonus spells are based on Charisma. Saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + the caster&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (if any). At each Red Mantis assassin level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on the table below. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, she can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, provided the new spell is of the same level as the one she is replacing.<br /><br />As she gains levels, a small number of additional spells that are not otherwise available to her are added to her list. She does not automatically learn these spells when they become available&mdash;they must be selected as part of her total spells known. At 2nd level, she adds <em>obscuring mist</em> and <em>true strike</em> to her spell list. At 4th level, she adds <em>darkness</em> and <em>summon swarm</em> to her spell list. At 6th level, she adds <em>fog cloud</em> and <em>see invisibility</em> to her spell list. At 8th level, she adds <em>clairaudience/ clairvoyance</em> and <em>hold person</em> to her spell list. At 10th level, she adds <em>dimension door</em> and <em>modify memory</em> to her spell list.<br /><br /><strong> Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This functions as the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt is +1d6 at 1st level and increases by 1d6 every 3rd level thereafter. If the Red Mantis assassin gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the damage bonuses stack.<br /><br /><strong> Sabre Fighting (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, the Red Mantis assassin gains Weapon Specialization (sawtooth sabre) as a bonus feat and treats sawtooth sabres as a light weapon for all purposes, including being able to use a sawtooth sabre with Weapon Finesse. At 5th level, she gains Greater Weapon Focus (sawtooth sabre) as a bonus feat. At 7th level, she gains Greater Weapon Specialization (sawtooth sabre) as a bonus feat. She does not need to otherwise qualify for these feats by having the minimum number of fighter levels.<br /><br /><strong> Prayer Attack (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Red Mantis assassin learns her signature assassination style. To initiate a prayer attack, she holds her sawtooth sabre (or sabres) out, point down, and weaves the blade in the air. She must be within 30 feet of and visible to her victim. Beginning a prayer attack is a standard action that causes her victim to be fascinated unless he succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + the Red Mantis assassin&rsquo;s class level + her Charisma modifier; if she&rsquo;s wielding two sawtooth sabres, the DC increases by 2). The fascination effect is a mind-affecting effect. She can maintain the fascination effect by concentrating. The victim can attempt a new save to escape this fascination each time a threat (other than the fascinating assassin) appears. At any point after 3 rounds, she can deliver a coup de grace to the target, provided the target is still fascinated; the Red Mantis assassin maintains this fascination effect while delivering a coup de grace. Activating or concentrating to maintain a prayer attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity.<br /><br /><strong> Red Shroud (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Red Mantis assassin can create a veil of red mist a number of times per day equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum once per day) as a move action. The red shroud persists for 1 round per class level, granting the Red Mantis assassin a +1 dodge bonus to AC and fast healing equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). This mist cannot be dissipated by wind. If she is slain while this ability is active, she can choose whether to remain corporeal or to disintegrate into a cloud of red mist that leaves behind only her gear, depriving her enemies of access to her remains.<br /><br /><strong> Summon Mantis (Sp)</strong>: Once per day at 4th level, a Red Mantis assassin can summon an advanced fiendish giant mantis, 1d3 fiendish giant mantises, or 1d4+1 giant mantises, as if using <em>summon monster V</em>. She can mentally direct the actions of these summoned vermin as a free action. All mantises summoned by this spell-like ability are blood red and gain no racial bonus on Stealth checks in forests.<br /><br /><strong> Resurrection Sense (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a Red Mantis assassin senses if a creature she has slain within the last year has been restored to life, as long as they are both on the same plane.<br /><br /><strong> Mantis Form (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a Red Mantis assassin can transform into a bloodred giant praying mantis once per day as a standard action, as if using <em>vermin shape II<sup>UM</sup></em> (caster level equals her class level). In addition to the normal adjustments to Strength, Dexterity, and natural armor provided by this spell effect, she gains the giant mantis&rsquo;s darkvision 60 feet; its grab ability; and its lunge, mandibles, and sudden strike extraordinary abilities, but not its immunity to mind-affecting effects or its racial modifiers to Perception and Stealth. If she wields a magical sawtooth sabre in her hand when she transforms, the magical enhancements on that weapon apply to her corresponding claw attack&mdash;if she wields two of them, then the enhancements each apply to their respective claw attacks. As she gains levels, her mantis form gains additional powers, as detailed below.<br /><br /><em> Blood Mantis</em>: At 8th level, her claw attacks deal 1d6 points of bleed damage on a hit. She also gains damage reduction 5/good while in this form.<br /><br /><em> Death Mantis</em>: At 10th level, whenever she deals damage with a bite attack as part of her mandibles ability, she also inflicts 1 negative level. The save DC to remove each of these negative levels is equal to 20 + the Red Mantis assassin&rsquo;s Constitution modifier. Each negative level inflicted in this manner grants the Red Mantis assassin 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. In addition, her damage reduction increases to DR 10/good while in this form.<br /><br /><strong> Fading (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, as an immediate action a number of times per day equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1), the Red Mantis assassin can become ethereal for an instant as she is attacked by a weapon or is forced to attempt a Reflex saving throw.

Charged with freeing slaves from the infernal nation&rsquo;s many plantations and escorting them to the safety of Andoran and Rahadoum, Bellflower tillers are a constant thorn in the side of House Thrune and its diabolical minions. These elite liberators practice their craft all across Cheliax, from the darkened streets of Egorian and Westcrown to the wilds of the Whisperwood. Bellflower tillers employ farming euphemisms to mask their activities from unfriendly ears&mdash; referring to their secret hideouts as &ldquo;barns,&rdquo; the slaves they escort as their &ldquo;crops,&rdquo; and the secret paths they take as &ldquo;rows.&rdquo; Excessive contact between Bellflower tillers is discouraged by the Bellflower Network&rsquo;s leadership, lest they risk exposing the organization to the authorities. Despite this, they often meet in secret to discuss which routes are safest to take, how much to bribe certain officials, and what tactics for organizing groups of slaves work best, and so improve chances of evading capture.<br /><br />Nearly all Bellflower tillers are halfling rogues, though some particularly zealous members have levels in both rogue and inquisitors and savvy members might have levels in both rogue and ranger. Vigilantes are also a natural fit as Bellflower tillers. Non-halflings are usually admitted only after proving their allegiance to the anti-slavery movement and their goodwill toward halflings, but once they join the cause, they are incredibly valuable to the organization for the simple fact that their race does not immediately raise suspicion in areas where the Bellflower Network is active.<br /><br />A Bellflower tiller&rsquo;s duty relies in part on her ability to establish a believable and viable cover identity. Many pose as traveling merchants or tinkerers&mdash;occupations that give them the freedom to get where they need to, when they need to&mdash;and have alibis for their presence on the road if confronted by Chelish patrols. Other Bellflower tillers join mercenary bands or adventuring groups, using their organizational and survival skills to help their companions in exchange for some extra muscle should a particular slave breakout proceed poorly.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Bellflower tiller, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Chaotic good. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Any two teamwork feats (<em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide</em> 150). <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Disguise 5 ranks, Knowledge (local) 3 ranks, Stealth 5 ranks, Survival 5 ranks.<br /><strong> Special</strong>: Sneak attack +2d6 or any 2 vigilante talents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Bellflower Tiller's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), and Survival (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 6 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">Bellflower crop, swift sower +10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">Crop guardian, scarcrow +1, teamwork feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">Sneak attack +1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">Scarecrow +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">1st favored barn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">Scarecrow +3, sneak attack +2d6, swift sower +20 ft., teamwork feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">2nd favored barn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">Scarecrow +4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">3rd favored barn, sneak attack +3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7254%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.6797%;\">Scarecrow +5, teamwork feat</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Bellflower tiller prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Bellflower Crop (Ex)</strong>: As a standard action, a Bellflower tiller can designate a number of allies up to 3 + her Charisma modifier as part of her Bellflower crop. Members of a crop must remain within 30 feet of the Bellflower tiller to gain any benefits from abilities that affect a Bellflower crop, regardless of the ability&rsquo;s source (whether it&rsquo;s a Bellflower harvester, irrigator, or tiller). If any leave this range, the Bellflower tiller must designate these allies again for them to be included in her crop. At 7th level, this range increases to 60 feet.<br /><br /><strong> Swift Sower (Ex)</strong>: A Bellflower tiller&rsquo;s base land speed is treated as being +10 feet faster when determining her overland travel speed while traveling long distances and while outside of combat. Members of her Bellflower crop can use either the Bellflower tiller&rsquo;s overland travel speed or their own, whichever is better. At 6th level, the bonus to speed increases to +20 feet.<br /><br /><strong> Crop Guardian (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, whenever a Bellflower tiller uses the aid another action for a member of her Bellflower crop, she grants a +3 bonus instead of the normal +2. Levels in the Bellflower tiller prestige class stack with any vigilante levels she has when calculating the effects of the Bellflower harvester&rsquo;s crop vigilance ability (see page 42).<br /><br /><strong> Scarecrow (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Bellflower tiller receives a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures that threaten attacks of opportunity against members of her Bellflower crop. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 10th level.<br /><br /><strong> Teamwork Feat</strong>: At 2nd level, a Bellflower tiller gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. This bonus feat must be a teamwork feat, and the Bellflower tiller must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat. At 6th level and 10th level, the Bellflower tiller gains an additional bonus teamwork feat.<br /><br /><strong> Sneak Attack</strong>: At 3rd level, a Bellflower tiller gains a sneak attack that functions like the rogue class feature of the same name. The extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. If a Bellflower tiller gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.<br /><br /><strong> Favored Barn (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a Bellflower tiller grows familiar with and develops trusted contacts in a particular community. While inside the limits of this community, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. Any ally designated as part of the Bellflower tiller&rsquo;s crop receives a bonus on these skills equal to half the tiller&rsquo;s bonus. A Bellflower tiller traveling through her favored community leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although she can leave a trail if she so desires).<br /><br />Provided that she isn&rsquo;t in immediate danger (such as fleeing from pursuers right on her heels), a Bellflower tiller can always find a safe place for her and members of her crop to rest in her chosen community. At such a location, she and her allies are fed, clothed, and provided with basic medical attention (as if attended by a person with a Heal bonus of +10).<br /><br />At 7th level and 9th level, the Bellflower tiller can select an additional community in which to receive these bonuses. Each time she selects a new community, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one chosen community (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.<br /><br />For the purposes of this ability, a community can be any settlement of 100 or more individuals. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are considered part of a community.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eZShxiJXWMbTTCXL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bellflower Crop (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/clover-purple.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.nFX6NXv1xQnNipTN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Swift Sower (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/clover-purple.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.o2rdmt2ZK2lrJFSH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Crop Guardian (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/clover-purple.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IaCFDKoeuoyRIkTB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Scarecrow (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/clover-purple.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.jpBI7of5g4YbY5zV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favored Barn (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/clover-purple.webp","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kD57bzGedm0ZIfdl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Teamwork Feat","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/clover-purple.webp","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.buaq8IPRmUNO3PHm","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/clover-purple.webp","level":3,"_index":6}]},"tag":"bellflowerTiller","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Bellflower Tiller","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Likewise, the great power wielded by these creatures has long intrigued wizards and alchemists who have sought various magical methods to infuse their bodies with draconic power. As a result, the blood of dragons runs through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline and a predilection for magic; for others, however, the power of their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession. <br /><br />Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors who possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished sorcerer but also the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their forebears, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and&mdash;at the pinnacle of their abilities&mdash;assume the form of a dragon. Although they are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: With the magic of a spellcasting class at their disposal, dragon disciples can assume the typical role of a magic-user, hampering the movement of the enemy and hurling damage-dealing spells at their opponents. Dragon disciples' draconic abilities, however, make these versatile spellcasters even more formidable, as they use their breath weapons and flight to destroy their foes directly. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Dragon disciples can be of any alignment, although they tend to be more chaotic than lawful. Those dragon disciples that assume the traits of chromatic dragons, such as bestial white and fearsome red dragons, have a proclivity for evil. Conversely, those that take after the metallic dragons, such as stoic brass and chivalric gold dragons, are often of good alignments.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a dragon disciple, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Race</strong>: Any nondragon. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Languages</strong>: Draconic. <br /><strong>Spellcasting</strong>: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells without preparation.

He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a dragon disciple, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Blood of Dragons</strong>: A dragon disciple adds his level to his sorcerer levels when determining the powers gained from his bloodline. If the dragon disciple does not have levels of sorcerer, he instead gains bloodline powers of the draconic bloodline, using his dragon disciple level as his sorcerer level to determine the bonuses gained. He must choose a dragon type upon gaining his first level in this class and that type must be the same as his sorcerer type. This ability does not grant bonus spells to a sorcerer unless he possesses spell slots of an appropriate level. Such bonus spells are automatically granted if the sorcerer gains spell slots of the spell's level. <br /><br /><strong>Natural Armor Increase (Ex)</strong>: As his skin thickens, a dragon disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor's physical aspect. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, a dragon disciple gains an increase to the character's existing natural armor (if any), as indicated on Table: Dragon Disciple. These armor bonuses stack. <br /><br /><strong>Ability Boost (Ex)</strong>: As a dragon disciple gains levels in this prestige class, his ability scores increase as noted on Table: Dragon Disciple. These increases stack and are gained as if through level advancement. <br /><br /><strong>Bloodline Feat</strong>: Upon reaching 2nd level, and every three levels thereafter, a dragon disciple receives one bonus feat, chosen from the draconic bloodline's bonus feat list. <br /><br /><strong>Dragon Bite (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, whenever the dragon disciple uses his bloodline to grow claws, he also gains a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the dragon disciple is Small), plus 1&ndash;1/2 times the dragon disciple's Strength modifier. Upon reaching 6th level, this bite also deals 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of damage dealt is determined by the dragon disciple's bloodline. <br /><br /><strong>Breath Weapon (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a dragon disciple gains the breath weapon bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple gains an additional use of his breath weapon each day. The type and shape of the breath weapon depends on the type of dragon selected by the dragon disciple, as detailed under the Draconic sorcerer bloodline description. <br /><br /><strong>Blindsense (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, the dragon disciple gains blindsense with a range of 30 feet. Using nonvisual senses the dragon disciple notices things he cannot see. He usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his blindsense ability, provided that he has line of effect to that creature. <br /><br />Any opponent the dragon disciple cannot see still has total concealment against him, and the dragon disciple still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. At 10th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet. <br /><br /><strong>Dragon Form (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, a dragon disciple can assume the form of a dragon. This ability works like <em>form of the dragon I</em>. At 10th level, this ability functions as <em>form of the dragon II </em>and the dragon disciple can use this ability twice per day. His caster level for this effect is equal to his effective sorcerer levels for his draconic bloodline. Whenever he casts <em>form of the dragon</em>, he must assume the form of a dragon of the same type as his bloodline. <br /><br /><strong>Wings (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, a dragon disciple gains the wings bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple's speed increases to 90 feet.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.XwE6vrsh3WcURmoO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blood of Dragons","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.CjWkRuUYHnXXlKB3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Natural Armor Increase (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LHmmC4WTIRIPA0yx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ability Boost (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wIaFnVCI6xs9gBAj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bloodline Feat","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MWqeSH3HlqvglDT9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dragon Bite (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EWoWFrZq63M1e6D7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Breath Weapon (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.iilS1MH6LxiBYg9Y","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blindsense (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":5,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.7iTWClnGSTFSp0d3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dragon Form (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":7,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rHHhLljG2YTpLYXf","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wings (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/orc.png","level":9,"_index":8}]},"tag":"dragonDisciple","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":12,"hp":12,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Every step brings a member that much closer to the final secret. Particularly promising members earn invitations to join an elite group within the organization. In their role as agents of the grave, these members serve the desires of the current leadership, yet more often than not, agents of the grave act solely for one cell or faction.<br /><br />Agents of the grave learn the deepest arcane secrets of the Whispering Way in their quest for undeath, gaining undeadlike traits before their final elevation to a state beyond death. These vile powers, paired with the ability to veil their intentions and increased breadth of knowledge, make agents of the grave perfect members for the task of turning powerful wizards and clerics to the path of the Whispering Way, as well as collectors of the foul relics, components, corpses, and morbid secrets that lie scattered across Golarion.<br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Agents of the grave master the necromantic arts, yet instead of controlling hordes of undead minions, they instead seek ultimate enlightenment, and possess subtle and murderous skills to help them attain it. Agents of the grave infiltrate other organizations to glean their magical secrets and have an interest in turning talented members to their own blasphemous discipline.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Agents of the grave are devoted to gaining personal power through the transition into undeath and advancement within the Whispering Way&rsquo;s macabre hierarchy. Callous to the needs and agendas of others, these elite servants of death are unwaveringly evil in their pursuit of an ascended death.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To become an agent of the grave, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any evil.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks.<br /><strong>Spells</strong>: Must be able to cast animate dead.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Must be a member of the Whispering Way for 1 year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Agent of the Grave's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Spellcraft (Int), Use Magic Device (Cha).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6851%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.26257%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.51769%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.3613%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.622%;\"><strong>Spells Per Day</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6851%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.26257%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.51769%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.3613%;\">Inspired necromancy, lich's touch, unholy fortitude</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.622%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6851%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.26257%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.51769%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.3613%;\">Undead manipulator</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.622%;\">+1 level of existing class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6851%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.26257%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.51769%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.3613%;\">Negative energy conduit</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.622%;\">+1 level of existing class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6851%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.26257%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.51769%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.3613%;\">Death's shroud, negative energy affinity</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.622%;\">+1 level of existing class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6851%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.26257%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 6.51769%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.3613%;\">Secrets of death, undead initiate</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.622%;\">+1 level of existing class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />All of the following are class features of the agent of the grave prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Agents of the grave gain no proficiency with any weapons or armor.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known</strong>: When a new agent of the grave level is gained, the character gains new spells as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character has more than one spellcasting class before becoming an agent of the grave, he must decide which class he adds the new level to for the purpose of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Inspired Necromancy (Ex)</strong>: When determining the maximum number of Hit Dice of undead he can control with spells like <em>animate dead</em>, a character counts his agent of the grave levels twice. This ability does not factor into how many undead he can create with a single casting of a spell. Thus, a cleric 7/agent of the grave 3 would be able to control 52 Hit Dice worth of undead with <em>animate dead</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Lich&rsquo;s Touch (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, the agent of the grave becomes a conduit for negative energy and the chill powers of death, allowing him to make a melee touch attack dealing 1d6 points of damage from negative energy per level of the agent of the grave class he attains. This ability allows him to heal undead minions, and himself upon attaining the negative energy affinity ability at 4th level. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma bonus.<br /><br /><strong>Unholy Fortitude (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, the agent of the grave can tap into his conviction and bolster his health. Starting with the hit points he rolls for gaining his first agent of the grave level and every time he gains a level in any class thereafter, the character may choose to add either his Constitution bonus or his Charisma bonus to the number of new hit points he gains for that level.<br /><br /><strong>Undead Manipulator (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, the agent of the grave gains great insight into the minds and necromantic forces controlling undead creatures. An agent of the grave&rsquo;s spells and spell-like abilities with mind-affecting effects treat undead creatures as their original type. Thus, an agent of the grave can use <em>charm person</em> against a humanoid zombie or <em>confusion</em> against a horde of skeletal champions.<br /><br /><strong>Negative Energy Conduit (Ex)</strong> At 3rd level, an agent of the grave bolsters undead around him. As a standard action, an agent of the grave manifests an aura identical to the <em>desecrate</em> spell, except this foul aura has a duration of 10 minutes per level. An agent of the grave can use this ability once per day. In addition, any undead the agent of the grave creates is treated as having been created within the area of a <em>desecrate</em> spell.<br /><br /><strong>Death&rsquo;s Shroud (Su)</strong>: As an agent of the grave gains power within the organization, he often must infiltrate other groups to gain further knowledge. At 4th level, he learns how to cloak his true intentions, gaining the ability to use <em>nondetection</em> or <em>undetectable alignment</em> once per day. The caster level for this ability is equal to the agent of the grave&rsquo;s highest caster level.<br /><br /><strong>Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, the agent of the grave, while still technically alive, reacts to positive and negative energy as if he were undead&mdash;positive energy harms him, while negative energy heals him. If the agent of the grave is already undead, this ability grants no additional benefit.<br /><br /><strong>Secrets of Death (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, an agent of the grave draws upon secrets held by the Whispering Way to gain insights into necromancy. At the time he gains this ability, the character may add a number of necromancy spells that are not normally a part of his class&rsquo;s spell list to his spell list. The number of spells that the character may add is equal to his Intelligence modifier. For example, an agent of the grave with levels of wizard might choose to add spells like <em>death watch</em>, <em>inflict critical wounds</em>, and <em>slay living</em> to his spell list, while an agent of the grave with levels of cleric might choose to add spells such as <em>enervation</em>, <em>magic jar</em>, and <em>vampiric touch</em>. An agent of the grave may choose to add spells he cannot yet cast&mdash;this does not allow the agent of the grave to cast spells of a higher level than he normally could, but rather merely grants him access to those spells when he reaches the level required to cast them.<br /><br /><strong>Undeath Initiate (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, an agent of the grave has prepared his body and mind for the transition into undeath. He gains a +5 bonus on any ability check, skill check, or saving throw related to the process of transforming into an undead creature. This bonus can be used on any check related to becoming a creature like a lich (the process of which is largely left up to the GM&rsquo;s discretion). Additionally, if slain by an undead creature with the create spawn ability, the agent of death retains his Intelligence (regardless of the type of undead he is transformed into) and free will (he is never under the control of the creature that killed him). Unless otherwise noted by the undead creature&rsquo;s create spawn ability, the newly created undead agent of the grave loses all of his class levels. This makes transformation into a lich and vampire among the most appealing options for an agent of the grave seeking undeath.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lhhPjVXoJ4ZlgFDu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Death's Shroud (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":5,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eXi1HOqcBECIbI43","dataType":"compendium","name":"Inspired Necromancy (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.V9zykqUtISwKFgdu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Lich's Touch (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lvBQUsWVAKXTiJKi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unholy Fortitude (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oOtQDt83fZKEIvQs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Secrets of Death (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Mfp4SEp0Sx1F1C2y","dataType":"compendium","name":"Undead Manipulator (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Sq2hB3h75gdTk1gZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Nw89fY2Kr7yQN4pE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Undeath Initiate (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/affliction_07.jpg","level":1,"_index":7}]},"tag":"agentOfTheGrave","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

He is often obsessed by the written word, with cryptic and arcane lore serving as his devoted mistress. Holding to the adage that knowledge is power, the loremaster often forsakes material wealth and personal glory for rare or unusual information, an endless quest that brings him ever closer to his unattainable goal: perfection through edification. Often rejecting what he views as the pointless affectations and transitory pleasures of his short-sighted neighbors, the loremaster believes that the only worthwhile goal in life is the acquisition of intellectual might. After all, wealth is spent, passions fade, and the power of the body is limited by age, while the mind's capacity to grow greater with time is infinite. <br /><br />The loremaster class holds little appeal for non-spellcasters&mdash;indeed, before one can devote a life to the studies and traditions of the loremaster, a character must first master several spells of the school of divination. Most loremasters begin their paths as clerics or wizards, but any character capable of casting enough divination spells can, eventually, become a loremaster. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Loremasters' lives are spent in study, research, and fieldwork. While the first two lend themselves to the loremaster's reputation as a bookish recluse, the latter oftentimes forces a loremaster to seek out the aid of adventurers who, through a mutually beneficial arrangement, might provide a degree of protection to the scholar while he seeks whatever knowledge he is after. For his part, the loremaster provides a wealth of information and arcane firepower to a party. Some loremasters actively deride those of their kind who fear to leave the safety of the temple or library, pointing out that only old lore can be discovered in books&mdash;new lore must be sought out in the world. These more active loremasters might join up with an adventuring party for the benefit of the journey, content with whatever knowledge might be picked up along the way. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Most loremasters cannot be bothered with distracting and pointless philosophies such as ethics, and so tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a loremaster, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (any two) 7 ranks in each. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Any three metamagic or item creation feats, plus Skill Focus (Knowledge [any individual Knowledge skill]). <br /><strong>Spells</strong>: Able to cast seven different

level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a loremaster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Secret</strong>: At 1st level and every two levels higher than 1st (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th), the loremaster chooses one secret from the Loremaster Secrets table. His level plus Intelligence modifier determines which secrets he can choose. He can't choose the same secret twice. <br /><br /></p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level + Int Modifier</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Secret</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Instant mastery</td>\n<td>4 ranks of a skill in which the character has no ranks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Secret health</td>\n<td>Toughness bonus feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Secrets of inner strength</td>\n<td>+2 bonus on Will saves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>The lore of true stamina</td>\n<td>+2 bonus on Fortitude saves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Secret knowledge of avoidance</td>\n<td>+2 bonus on Reflex saves</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Weapon trick</td>\n<td>+1 bonus on attack rolls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Dodge trick</td>\n<td>+1 dodge bonus to AC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Applicable knowledge</td>\n<td>Any one feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Newfound arcana</td>\n<td>1 bonus 1st-level spell*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>More newfound arcana</td>\n<td>1 bonus 2nd-level spell*</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tfoot>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">* As if gained through having a high ability score.</td>\n</tr>\n</tfoot>\n</table>\n<p><br /><strong>Lore</strong>: At 2nd level, a loremaster adds half his level to all Knowledge skill checks and may make such checks untrained. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from Bardic Knowledge. <br /><br /><strong>Bonus Languages</strong>: A loremaster can learn any new language at 4th and 8th level. <br /><br /><strong>Greater Lore (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a loremaster gains the ability to understand magic items. Whenever a loremaster examines a magic item to determine its properties, he gains a +10 circumstance bonus on his Spellcraft skill check. <br /><br /><strong>True Lore (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a loremaster's knowledge becomes vast indeed. Once per day a loremaster can use his knowledge to gain the effect of a legend lore spell or an analyze dweomer spell. If used to create a legend lore effect, this ability has a casting time of 1 minute, regardless of how much information is already known about the subject in question.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.58JkNQzBYenNQUjz","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Languages","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-worn-blue.webp","level":4,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.D8v2eyg0JbtedauS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Lore (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-worn-blue.webp","level":6,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EIR65xvjRTXRyzl2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Lore","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-worn-blue.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oMqgDHN9TciXz3Yz","dataType":"compendium","name":"Secret","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-worn-blue.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vFTCo4GqKlsiQNa8","dataType":"compendium","name":"True Lore (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-worn-blue.webp","level":10,"_index":4}]},"tag":"loremaster","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They arbitrate disputes, deal with criminals, and establish law where there is none. In pleasant times they are diplomats, in dangerous ones they are judge, jury, and executioner. Their feet leave trails destined to become great roads, and their decrees carry the force of law. Being a justiciar is a serious duty and is not taken lightly&mdash;they tend to wear down over time, weathered not from travel and sunlight but from the heavy burden of carrying civilization forward into the future. A rare few pursue heretics of their own religion, keeping the faith stable and weeding out unruly elements. Each is sworn to uphold a religious or secular code.<br /><br />Justiciars are usually clerics or paladins of Abadar, but order-minded individuals of other classes (particularly fighters, monks, and wizards) sometimes heed the calling to tend the roots of enlightened society.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a justiciar, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria:<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any lawful.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Diplomacy 4 ranks, Knowledge (local) 8 ranks, and 6 ranks total in Craft, Knowledge (arcana, architecture and engineering, history, nobility and royalty, or religion), or Profession skills in any combination.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Investigator or Negotiator, prof iciency with any crossbow.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: A justiciar must be appointed by a lawful religious or secular authority, typically a governing official of higher rank than the character.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Justicar's class skills are Appraise, Bluff, Craft, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, Knowledge (any), Profession, Sense Motive, Speak Language, Survival.<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45294%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8524%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3594%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.7337%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45294%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8524%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3594%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.7337%;\">Aura of law, authority, lawkeeper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45294%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8524%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3594%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.7337%;\">Sure shot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45294%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8524%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.3594%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.7337%;\">Oathmark</td>\n</tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the justiciar.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Justiciars gain no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Aura of Law (Ex)</strong>: The power of a justiciar&rsquo;s aura of law (see the <em>detect law</em> spell) is equal to her character level. If the justiciar has cleric or paladin levels, the power of her aura of law is equal to her character level +4.<br /><br /><strong>Authority (Su)</strong>: A justiciar serves a religious or legal code and has absolute authority (granted by a higher-ranking agent of that code) to enforce it. This means that if the justiciar catches criminals, she may judge them guilty (given sufficient proof ) and order their execution, or do it herself if need be. Because the justiciar must act within the law, there is rarely any friction between her and established authorities other than disputes about jurisdiction and challenges from other forms of authority. (A religiously endorsed justiciar, for example, might come into conflict with secular governors who take exception to the execution of their subjects.) A justiciar may deputize others to aid her in her tasks, although she is responsible for their actions in her name.<br /><br />As part of a Diplomacy and Intimidate check regarding matters of the law and her authority, a justiciar may exert her authority to grant herself a +4 bonus on these checks. This ability negates any need to carry a badge or writ of office, and is mainly used to convince those unfamiliar with the justiciar of her legal powers. For example, a justiciar can use this ability to check an angry mob intent on lynching a jailed prisoner, or convince a stubborn mayor that interfering with the justiciar&rsquo;s efforts is likely to anger the lord they both work for. Even against individuals who don&rsquo;t acknowledge his code of laws (such as thieves or warriors from other lands), the justicar&rsquo;s fervor still grants these skill bonuses. She does not, however, gain these bonuses in situations where her code of laws would not apply or hold no bearing (like against monsters or savages). The GM ultimately adjudicates who the justiciar&rsquo;s authority applies against.<br /><br />In addition, a justiciar&rsquo;s knowledge of her code is magically flawless, as if she were mentally reviewing a perfect copy of the code. If the source of the code changes (such as a decree from the church&rsquo;s high priest or a new law created by a king), she instantly knows it. This perfect knowledge means she immediately recognizes any misquoting of the law (deliberate or accidental), and many justiciars consider it their duty to review the law book in remote settlements to make sure there are no errors in transcription or translation. A justiciar may always take 10 on Knowledge checks regarding the code, even when rushed or threatened.<br /><br /><strong>Lawkeeper</strong>: Justiciars are not allowed to violate their code or any oath or contract they willingly agree to, nor can they go against the spirit of it while holding to the letter. A justiciar who willingly does so loses all prestige class abilities until she receives an <em>atonement</em> spell from her religious superiors or an official pardon from her secular superiors.<br /><br /><strong>Sure Shot</strong>: A justiciar is skilled with crossbows. At 2nd level, she gains the ability to make a sure shot. A number of times per day equal to her class level, a justiciar may add her Charisma bonus on an attack roll made with a crossbow and deal 1 extra point of damage per justiciar level.<br /><br /><strong>Oathmark (Su)</strong>: This ability magically seals an oath or agreement between two people. The justiciar chooses two willing creatures and presses her authority upon them. By accepting her authority and stating their agreement on something (whether a verbal promise, written contract, treaty, or the like), the two creatures are magically linked so that if one breaks the agreement, the other knows it. The expiration of the link does not explain the exact nature of the betrayal, only that it has occurred. If one target dies, the link ends and the other target knows the other party is dead.<br /><br />Direct and indirect attempts to violate the agreement end the link; swearing not to kill someone and then hiring someone else to do it is a violation, as is hiring assassins before the agreement with the orders to kill the person later. The link cannot penetrate other planes, areas where magic does not function, or spells such as mind blank that block mind reading. Once the interference ends, the link resumes and determines if the agreement has been broken. The other person in the link knows if the link is blocked, but not why.<br /><br />The creature who breaks the agreement is cursed with a raised physical mark on the forehead (or other obvious place) indicating his willing violation of the agreement. The target takes a &ndash;4 penalty on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks when dealing with those who dislike oathbreakers. Magical attempts to remove the mark&mdash;such as via <em>remove curse</em>&mdash;require a successful caster level check (DC 10 + justiciar&rsquo;s character level). Even if the curse is removed, the other party in the agreement still knows of the betrayal. The mark is colored and textured as the justicar chooses, and cannot be hidden with makeup, tattoos, or scars, although greater physical obstructions (such as a long wig or low-hanging hat) can conceal it.<br /><br />This is a permanent divination effect. Creating a link is a standard action. The justiciar may use this ability up to three times per day.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PgeWNSXKjNi4AcNy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aura of Law (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/pavise-wooden-wings-blue-white.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YMWTuWtjAsmoBgmP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Authority (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/pavise-wooden-wings-blue-white.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sJGZNRlCZPABWoL4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Lawkeeper","img":"icons/equipment/shield/pavise-wooden-wings-blue-white.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Yhggkol6uVcgsGPs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Oathmark (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/pavise-wooden-wings-blue-white.webp","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.k5S5PArYaCZhUqnh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sure Shot","img":"icons/equipment/shield/pavise-wooden-wings-blue-white.webp","level":2,"_index":4}]},"tag":"justicar","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Using a special deck of cards known as a Harrow deck, one can perform a harrowing by laying the cards out in a three-by-three grid that reveals secrets of the target&rsquo;s past, present, and future.<br /><br />Whether or not the revelations and divinations of a typical harrowing are trustworthy, none can deny that the strange powers wielded by the harrower are real. The harrower uses the ancient art of fortune-telling to harness destiny and thus augment her spellcasting abilities, infusing them with power by drawing cards from her Harrow deck and letting fate decide what elements of her magic need augmentation.<br /><br />Several of the harrower&rsquo;s powers require the drawing of cards from a Harrow deck. You can use an actual Harrow deck for this act (Harrow decks are available at <strong>paizo.com</strong> or at many gaming stores), but you can also simulate a draw from such a deck of cards as detailed on page 293, under the equipment entry for Harrow decks. For most of the harrower&rsquo;s class features, you need only roll 1d6 to determine the suit of each card drawn for a Harrow casting.

She does not, however, gain any other benefits a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of harrower to the level of whatever other spellcasting class she has. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a harrower, she must choose which class she adds each harrower level to for the purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br />A harrower adds the <em>harrowing</em> spell (see page 295) to all of her spell lists as a 3rd-level spell if it is not already on a spell list.<br /><br /><strong>Blessing of the Harrow (Su)</strong>: Once per day, a harrower may perform a harrowing for herself and all allies within 20 feet of her. This harrowing takes 10 minutes, and allies to be affected by it must remain within 20 feet of the harrower for the entire time. At the conclusion of the harrowing, count up the number of cards from each suit that were used in the reading. This harrowing provides a bonus based upon the suit with the most cards showing. In case of a tie, choose one suit. The bonus lasts for 24 hours. The suits grant insight bonuses as follows. Strength: +1 on attack rolls; Dexterity: +1 to AC; Constitution: +1 on weapon damage rolls; Intelligence: +1 on all skill checks; Wisdom: +1 on all saving throws; Charisma: +1 on caster level and concentration checks.<br /><br /><strong>Harrow Casting (Su)</strong>: Beginning at 2nd level, a harrower may, as she casts a spell, draw three cards from her Harrow deck. This adds both a somatic component (if the spell does not already have one) and a focus component (the Harrow deck) to the spell, but does not increase the spell&rsquo;s casting time. Depending on the harrower&rsquo;s level, the cards she draws might change the parameters of her spell or grant her some other benefit, as described in each tower ability. The harrower gains all of the different tower abilities available to her. If she draws cards that she has not yet gained the use of, those cards provide no benefit. Each card the harrower draws that exactly matches her alignment counts as two cards of that suit. A spell may not be affected by both Harrow casting and a metamagic feat. The harrower may use this ability a number of times per day equal to her class level.</p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Alignment</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Opposite</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Partial Matches</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LG</td>\n<td>CE</td>\n<td>CG, LE, LN, NG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>NE</td>\n<td>CG, LG, N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CG</td>\n<td>LE</td>\n<td>CE, CN, LG, NG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LN</td>\n<td>CN</td>\n<td>LE, LG, N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CN</td>\n<td>LN</td>\n<td>CE, CG, N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LE</td>\n<td>CG</td>\n<td>CE, LG, LN, NE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NE</td>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>CE, LE, N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CE</td>\n<td>LG</td>\n<td>CG, CN, LE, NE</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Tower of Intelligence (Su)</strong>: Beginning at 2nd level, whenever a harrower uses her Harrow casting ability, for each card she draws from the suit of Intelligence, she gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks made to penetrate Spell Resistance.<br /><br /><strong>Tower of Strength (Su)</strong>: Beginning at 3rd level, whenever a harrower uses her Harrow casting ability to augment a spell that deals damage to hit points, the spell deals +1 point of damage per die for each card from the suit of Strength she draws.<br /><br /><strong>Tower of Charisma (Su)</strong>: Beginning at 4th level, whenever a harrower uses her Harrow casting ability, for each card she draws from the suit of Charisma, the save DC of the spell increases by +1.<br /><br /><strong>Spirit Deck (Su)</strong>: A 5th-level harrower may, as a standard action, summon a shimmering, translucent Harrow deck made of force that f lies through the air and engulfs a target within 30 feet in a whirling cloud of knife-edged cards. The harrower then draws a number of Harrow cards equal to her harrower level from her personal Harrow deck, and the spirit deck deals damage based on the number of drawn cards that match her alignment, as shown on the chart to the right. Each exact match deals 5 points of damage, each partial match deals 3 points, each non-matched card deals 1 point, and each opposite match deals 0 points. The harrower may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1/day).<br /><br /><strong>Divination (Sp)</strong>: A 6th-level harrower gains the ability to cast <em>divination</em> once per day as a spell-like ability. Her caster level equals her character level.<br /><br /><strong>Tower of Constitution (Ex)</strong>: Beginning at 7th level, whenever a harrower uses her Harrow casting ability, for each card she draws from the suit of Constitution, she heals 1d6 points of damage.<br /><br /><strong>Tower of Dexterity (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, whenever a harrower uses her Harrow casting ability, for each card she draws from the suit of Dexterity, she gains a +1 bonus on Ref lex saves and to AC until the beginning of her next turn.<br /><br /><strong>Tower of Wisdom (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, whenever a harrower uses her Harrow casting ability, for each card she draws from the suit of Wisdom, she increases the spell&rsquo;s effective caster level by +1.<br /><br /><strong>Reading the Signs (Ex)</strong>: When a 10th-level harrower draws cards from any deck of cards in order to either activate a class ability (such as Harrow casting) or to activate a magic item function, she may draw an extra card and choose one to ignore and shuff le back into the deck. The harrower may not use this ability when performing a harrowing, but may use it when performing her Harrow casting or spirit deck abilities. She can also use this ability when drawing cards from magical decks, such as a <em>deck of many things</em>. She may use this ability at will, but must wait 1d4 rounds between each use.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.l2ScM18JPcHj6E62","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blessing of the Harrow (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.nB3FkWMDt8b75D3p","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divination (Sp)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":6,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NgGQ80uiwIbckeUh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Harrow Casting (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KPOG1CMjk7M5bbCv","dataType":"compendium","name":"Reading the Signs (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":10,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IQGNLG7hseEG8WG0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spirit Deck (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.UhlEsz4D9utIldtM","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tower of Charisma (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.xBeVV3IkgU1hjpLY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tower of Constitution (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":7,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cXTyqKoPmY0k7wUW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tower of Dexterity (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":8,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gwZJB6sOfwrkSpUD","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tower of Intelligence (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":2,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FziD27RaGroNKWAk","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tower of Strength (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":3,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oNz3KmMw1AmkmMwh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tower of Wisdom (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-grey.webp","level":9,"_index":10}]},"tag":"harrower","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

For some, this journey is purely about the wealth, for others the glory of discovery, and still more are stirred by the irresistible drive to uncover the bones of the ages and legends of forgotten epochs in an effort to chronicle the deeds of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. <br /><br />The Pathfinder chronicler class attracts any who see the world as a great mystery to be unraveled, and thus has a diverse and varied following, from fighters and bards to wizards and clerics, and everything in between. However, due to their role as historians and preservers of posterity, hopefuls must be literate and scholarly&mdash;for Pathfinder chroniclers are more than mere treasure hunters. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: The Pathfinder chronicler's missions often thrust her into the role of party leader, and adventures typically result from, and revolve around, his endless quests. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: A Pathfinder chronicler's alignment largely determines her motivations. Good characters tend to view their missions as noble ventures, neutral characters seek to preserve knowledge for knowledge's sake, and evil characters are driven by an urge to accumulate wealth and add to their own glory.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Pathfinder chronicler, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Linguistics 3 ranks, Perform (oratory) 5 ranks, Profession (scribe) 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: Must have authored or scribed something (other than a magical scroll or other device) for which another person (not a PC) paid at least 50 gp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Pathfinder Chronicler's class skills are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Use Magic Device (Cha).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 8 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Bardic knowledge, deep pockets, master scribe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Live to tell the tale, pathfinding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Bardic music, improved aid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Epic tales</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Whispering campaign</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Inspired action (move)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Call down the legends</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Greater epic tales</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Inspired action (standard)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4559%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Lay of the exalted dead</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Pathfinder chronicler prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Bardic Knowledge (Ex)</strong>: This ability is identical to the bard class feature of the same name, and levels in this class stack with levels in any other class that grants a similar ability. <br /><br /><strong>Deep Pockets (Ex)</strong>: A Pathfinder chronicler collects items as well as lore, picking up small amounts of this or that throughout her travels. As a result, she may carry unspecified equipment worth up to 100 gp per class level. This can be any kind of gear that can reasonably fit into a backpack, including potions and scrolls (but not any other sort of magic item). As a full-round action, the chronicler may dig through her pockets to retrieve an item she specifies at that time, deducting its value from the allocated amount of cost. This item cannot weigh more than 10 pounds. When the total remaining cost reaches 0, the chronicler can retrieve no more items until she refills her deep pockets by spending a few hours and an amount of gold to bring her total up to 100 gp per class level. <br /><br />In addition, if she takes 1 hour to pack her gear each day, she gains a +4 bonus to Strength to determine her light encumbrance. This does not affect her maximum carrying capacity. The efficient distribution of weight simply encumbers her less than the same amount of weight normally should. Finally, the Pathfinder chronicler gains a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal small objects on her person. <br /><br /><strong>Master Scribe (Ex)</strong>: A Pathfinder chronicler adds her class level as a bonus on all Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, as well as Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls or other written magical items. A Pathfinder chronicler can make Linguistics checks to decipher text as a full-round action and can always take 10 on Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, even if distracted or endangered. <br /><br /><strong>Live to Tell the Tale (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, once per day per two class levels, a Pathfinder chronicler can attempt a new saving throw against any ongoing condition against which she failed a saving throw in a previous round, even if the effect is normally permanent. This ability has no effect on conditions that do not allow saving throws or against instantaneous effects. <br /><br /><strong>Pathfinding (Ex)</strong>: Beginning at 2nd level, a Pathfinder chronicler develops an excellent sense of direction and skill at leading others through difficult terrain or by following ancient maps. A Pathfinder chronicler gains a +5 bonus on Survival checks made to avoid becoming lost and to Intelligence checks to escape a <em>maze </em>spell. In addition, she always uses the &ldquo;road or trail&rdquo; overland movement modifier even when in trackless terrain, whether on foot or mounted. With a DC 15 Survival check, the Pathfinder chronicler can extend this benefit to one companion per class level. <br /><br /><strong>Bardic Performance (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Pathfinder chronicler gains this ability, which functions like the bard class feature of the same name, except that the chronicler's effective bard level is 2 lower than her class level. Levels in this class stack with levels in any other class that grants a similar ability to determine her effective bard level. <br /><br /><strong>Improved Aid (Ex)</strong>: Pathfinder chroniclers frequently serve as the companions of great heroes, standing by their sides and recording their deeds, but often lending a crucial helping hand. Starting at 3rd level, a Pathfinder chronicler using the aid another action grants a +4 bonus, rather than the normal +2. <br /><br /><strong>Epic Tales (Su)</strong>: A 4th-level Pathfinder chronicler can inscribe a tale so evocative and so moving that it conveys the effects of bardic music through the written word. To create an epic tale requires the pathfinder chronicler to expend a number of rounds of her bardic performance ability equal to twice the duration of the epic tale (maximum duration of 10 rounds), and any relevant Performance skill check is made with Profession (scribe) instead. An epic tale affects only the reader, but it grants all the benefits that would normally apply for hearing a performance. A Pathfinder chronicler may apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic music to her epic tales. An epic tale retains its supernatural potency for 1 day per class level. It requires 1 hour to inscribe, a full-round action to activate, and has a duration equal to 1/2 the number of bardic performance rounds expended during its creation. Once activated, an epic tale's magic is consumed. <br /><br /><strong>Whispering Campaign (Ex)</strong>: Pathfinder chroniclers influence the world through their control of information and ability to shape public perception. At 5th level, as a special use of bardic music, the Pathfinder chronicler can create the effect of a <em>doom </em>spell as cast by a sorcerer of her class level by denouncing a creature in person. This is a language-dependent effect. <br /><br />Alternatively, the chronicler can denounce a particular target (an individual or a definable group of creatures) to others. This form of bardic music creates the effect of the <em>enthrall </em>spell, but at the end of the performance all creatures who failed to save shift their attitude toward the target of the oration by one step (in the direction of the Pathfinder chronicler's choice) for 1 day per class level. <br /><br /><strong>Inspire Action (Su)</strong>: As a special use of bardic music, a 6th-level Pathfinder chronicler can exhort any one ally within hearing to a sudden surge of action, allowing her ally to immediately take an extra move action. This does not count against the ally's number of actions on his own turn. <br /><br />At 9th level, she can enable an ally to immediately take a standard action instead. <br /><br /><strong>Call Down the Legends (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, once per week as a full-round action, a Pathfinder chronicler can summon 2d4 4th-level human barbarians, as if she used a bronze <em>horn of Valhalla</em>; these summoned barbarians serve her with complete loyalty. The barbarians are constructs, not actual people (although they seem to be). They arrive with the normal starting equipment for barbarians and attack anyone the chronicler designates. <br /><br /><strong>Greater Epic Tales (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, the Pathfinder chronicler's written word gains power. This ability functions like the chronicler's epic tales ability, except that if read aloud, the bardic music takes effect as if the author had used the ability, but the effects are targeted by the reader and use the reader's Charisma score where applicable. <br /><br /><strong>Lay of the Exalted Dead (Su)</strong>: Once per week as a full-round action, a 10th-level Pathfinder chronicler can summon 1d4+1 5th-level human barbarians, as if she used an iron <em>horn of Valhalla</em>. The summoned barbarians serve her with complete and unquestioning loyalty. They are constructs, with the incorporeal subtype (they take 50% of the damage from corporeal sources, and no damage from nonmagical sources). They arrive wearing <em>+2 studded leather </em>and wielding <em>+1 ghost touch greataxes </em>(allowing them to deal full damage to corporeal creatures) and attack anyone the chronicler designates. To the chronicler and their allies, these exalted dead appear like a noble troop of spectral warriors. Her enemies, however, behold the terrible wrath of the ancient heroes and must succeed at Will saves or become shaken for 1 round per summoned barbarian (DC 15 + the Pathfinder chronicler's Charisma modifier).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.89m9nTCjkMctvCkd","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deep Pockets (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.42CQ8sQewFpNuRF2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master Scribe (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.D5hKVzwgsqT2E9L5","dataType":"compendium","name":"Live to Tell the Tale (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gUlxAKsbwjYtCpn6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Pathfinding (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IzphVhUKQH5PxkDJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Epic Tales (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aKGSLRAGyF6xnJSi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Whispering Campaign (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wICLbP1NN1oWCijY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Inspire Action (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":6,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.b1SBzO7ajoTzFC8X","dataType":"compendium","name":"Call Down the Legends (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":7,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tsVTdsepOZFx33w3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Epic Tales (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":8,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fW7efUqtIuGDvdoi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Lay of the Exalted Dead (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":10,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9Zt19PDlJeUIZUSy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bardic Performance (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":3,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sGfahttGUtXCIKCm","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bardic Knowledge (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-chart-tan.webp","level":1,"_index":11}]},"tag":"pathfinderChronicler","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":8,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":true,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

At their culmination lies the ability to invest pain and discord into a spirit companion, and to take in a portion of that spirit&rsquo;s burden in exchange. This process creates a powerful bond to the spirit realms, allowing the Rivethun emissary to sense and pacify otherworldly creatures, and to channel powerful outsiders into the physical form of her spirit animal, creating a powerful hybrid called an animus to guide, protect, and advise her. Rivethun emissaries develop much like shamans, but their powerful bond with a singular spirit guide stunts their ability to bond with any wayward spirits they encounter.<br /><br />Few Rivethun emissaries still exist among the Five Kings Mountains, and many dwarves consider the art of mingling mortal soul with outsider quintessence to be an abomination. Most learn the art from long-discarded writings or ancient and powerful beings that haunt former sacred sites deep below the surface.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify

features of the Rivethun emissary prestige class.<br /><br /><strong> Spirit Animal (Ex)</strong>: A Rivethun emissary strengthens her bond to the spirit world by channeling additional divine power through her familiar or spirit animal. If she had a non-spirit-animal familiar before becoming a Rivethun emissary, she can select a single shaman spirit (<em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</em> 37). Her familiar gains the spirit animal ability associated with that spirit.<br /><br />If the Rivethun emissary had the spirit animal class feature before becoming a Rivethun emissary, her spirit animal grows in power and begins to manifest unnatural traits. The spirit animal gains 2 evolution points as if it were an eidolon (see page 60 of <em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide</em>) and can use them to purchase eidolon evolutions from the following list: basic magic<sup>UM</sup>, climb<sup>APG</sup>, flight<sup>APG</sup>, gills<sup>APG</sup>, improved natural armor<sup>APG</sup>, magic attacks<sup>APG</sup>, minor magic<sup>UM</sup>, skilled<sup>APG</sup>, swim<sup>APG</sup>, tail<sup>APG</sup>, and unnatural aura<sup>UM</sup>. At 5th level, the Rivethun emissary&rsquo;s spirit animal gains an additional evolution point. It can spend this point to gain an additional evolution, or it can freely reassign all of its points to purchase different evolutions. It also adds the following to its list of available evolutions: burrow<sup>APG</sup>, damage reduction<sup>APG</sup>, and major magic<sup>UM</sup>.<br /><br /><strong> Spirit Bond (Su)</strong>: A Rivethun emissary&rsquo;s training creates a powerful bond with a specific spirit. Her Rivethun emissary levels stack with any shaman levels she has for the purpose of determining the effects of her spirit class ability, spirit magic class ability, what hexes she qualifies for, and the effects of any hexes with level-dependent abilities.<br /><br />If a Rivethun emissary has neither the spirit class ability nor a spirit animal, she can select a single spirit from those available to the shaman upon gaining her 1st level of Rivethun emissary. She gains this spirit&rsquo;s spirit ability. At 8th level, she also gains this spirit&rsquo;s greater spirit ability.<br /><br />Spirit bond does not affect a shaman&rsquo;s wandering spirit class ability.<br /><br /><strong> Sixth Sense (Sp)</strong>: A Rivethun emissary gains <em>detect undead</em> as a spell-like ability, usable a number of times per day equal to her Rivethun emissary level.<br /><br />At 2nd level, this spell-like ability also detects creatures of the fey type. The Rivethun emissary must continue concentrating to discern which auras are undead and which are fey, gaining this knowledge as she learns the strength and location of each aura on her third round of concentration.<br /><br />At 3rd level, this spell-like ability also detects creatures of the outsider type, also requiring concentration to distinguish between aura types.<br /><br /><strong> Animus (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Rivethun emissary learns to call down more powerful spiritual servants, using her spirit animal as the focus and conduit to create a hybrid creature called an animus. This ability functions as <em>summon monster IV</em>, except the Rivethun emissary can summon only a single creature at a time (though she can select a different creature each time and can always decide to summon a single creature from a lower-level list). This summoned creature appears in the spirit animal&rsquo;s location, replaces the spirit animal for the spell&rsquo;s duration, gains the familiar&rsquo;s spirit animal ability, and obeys the Rivethun emissary as if it were her spirit animal. An animus typically retains some superficial traits of the spirit animal used as a conduit in its summoning, but gains no other abilities normally associated with a familiar (such as share spells or evolution points). The Rivethun emissary must be within 30 feet of her spirit animal to use this ability.<br /><br />The animus remains for 1 round per caster level; it vanishes once this duration expires or it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The spirit animal reappears in the animus&rsquo;s last location and suffers none of the damage, status effects, or spells affecting the animus when it vanished.<br /><br />As the Rivethun emissary grows in power and prestige, the effective <em>summon monster</em> spell she can use to conjure an animus improves, as indicated on the table.<br /><br />The Rivethun emissary can use this ability once per day. At 4th level, she can use it twice per day, and at 8th level, she can use it three times per day.<br /><br /><strong> Manifest Will (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, spiritual energy flows both into and out of the Rivethun emissary, allowing her to overcome the limitations of her physical body by sheer force of will. The Rivethun emissary selects either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. As an immediate action, she can substitute her Wisdom modifier for her selected ability&rsquo;s modifier on a single ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier + half her Rivethun emissary level.<br /><br />At 6th level and again at 9th level, she can select one more physical ability score she can affect with this ability.<br /><br /><strong> Parley (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, a Rivethun emissary gains the ability to cast <em>calm spirit<sup>OA</sup></em> three times per day as a spell-like ability (her caster level equals her character level). At 6th level, she can also use this spell-like ability to calm corporeal undead and creatures of the outsider type. At 7th level, she can use this spell-like ability to calm creatures of the fey type as well.<br /><br /><strong> Spirit Conduit (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a Rivethun emissary&rsquo;s bond to an animus strengthens considerably. Any animus she summons is treated as if the Rivethun emissary had the Augment Summoning feat, gaining a +4 enhancement bonus to its Strength and Constitution.<br /><br />At 7th level, when the animus vanishes, the Rivethun emissary can have her spirit animal appear in an empty square adjacent to herself instead of in the animus&rsquo;s location.<br /><br />At 10th level, the bond allows the animus to leave parting insight when it vanishes, answering a single yes-or-no question for the Rivethun emissary as per <em>commune</em>.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.S5L7YghMWyixruf4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spirit Animal (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/materials/glass-orb-blue-gold.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AQ1yZQWASDrd9dzR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spirit Bond (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/materials/glass-orb-blue-gold.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8stNZEPBiuVXSFOJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sixth Sense (Sp)","img":"icons/commodities/materials/glass-orb-blue-gold.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wrTxDt1y3BA7souV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Animus (Sp)","img":"icons/commodities/materials/glass-orb-blue-gold.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.jETvA8X0eAsfHWKt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Parley (Sp)","img":"icons/commodities/materials/glass-orb-blue-gold.webp","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.g4JPVAjmupFmF0E3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spirit Conduit (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/materials/glass-orb-blue-gold.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TewYQ3TQt5nbzZUG","dataType":"compendium","name":"Manifest Will (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/materials/glass-orb-blue-gold.webp","level":6,"_index":6}]},"tag":"rivethunEmissary","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The path of the savant brings expertise in the lore of glyphs and sigils, knowledge of exotic spells, and the power to unlock the full potential of magical devices. This skill also makes savants quite valuable to adventuring parties, both in their mastery over ancient traps that utilize old magic and in their skill at identifying and utilizing magic items found in the field. Of course, with their focus on the intellectual portions of adventuring, Pathfinder savants are often ill-equipped to handle the tougher, more excruciating parts of a typical dungeon delve; melee combat, wrenching open stuck doors, and enduring dangerous and unhealthy environments are not the savant&rsquo;s forte. As a result, they rarely undertake solo missions, instead allying with wellrounded groups of fellow adventurers in order to interact with history and strange archaic wonders without dealing with the grislier portions of exploration all on their own. To the Pathfinder savant, this is merely a logical extension of their preferred role in exploration, but that doesn&rsquo;t protect them from periodic sneers and veiled insults from more physically focused companions. Of course, most such associates are quick to beg forgiveness when, inevitably, the savant is needed to decipher the workings of a strange magical device or to call upon their significant magical power to solve problems that cannot be dealt with through brawn alone.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Pathfinder savant, a character must fulfill the following

Pathfinder savant can always take 10 on Use Magic Device checks, except when activating an item blindly. A Pathfinder savant does not automatically fail a Use Magic Device check if he rolls a natural 1 on the check.<br /><br /><strong> Master Scholar (Ex)</strong>: A Pathfinder savant adds half his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks. He can always take 10 on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks, even if distracted or endangered.<br /><br /><strong> Esoteric Magic (Ex)</strong>: At each class level beyond 1st, the Pathfinder savant chooses a spell from any class&rsquo;s spell list and thereafter treats that spell as if it were on the spell list of the base spellcasting class for which he has the most levels; if this base spellcasting class could not normally cast that spell, it is treated as 1 level higher than it is on the original class&rsquo;s spell list. If he could cast the spell using his base spellcasting class, the spell&rsquo;s level does not increase. The spell is cast as if its type (arcane, divine, or psychic) were that of his base spellcasting class, and save DCs function as normal for spells of that class. All other restrictions of his normal spellcasting class apply. This ability does not grant other spellcasters special allowance to prepare, cast, or use spell-trigger or spell-completion items of esoteric spells (such as a sorcerer using a <em>cure light wounds</em> scroll prepared by the Pathfinder savant).<br /><br /><strong> Glyph-Finding (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Pathfinder savant can use Spellcraft to find writing-based magical traps (including glyphs, runes, sigils, and symbols) in the same way a rogue can use Perception to search for traps.<br /><br /><strong> Scroll Master (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Pathfinder savant can use his own caster level instead of the item&rsquo;s caster level when using a scroll or other spell-completion item.<br /><br /><strong> Quick Identification (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, a Pathfinder savant can use <em>identify</em> as a swift action (caster level equals his character level). He can do this once per day per 2 class levels.<br /><br /><strong> Sigil Master (Su)</strong>: A 5th level, a Pathfinder savant receives a bonus equal to his class level on saving throws against writing-based magical traps, and if he succeeds at the save, he does not trigger the trap. Such a trap is not disabled, and if he leaves the trap&rsquo;s area and then reenters it, the trap can trigger again. A Pathfinder savant also receives this bonus on saving throws against the effects of such traps triggered by others.<br /><br /><strong> Analyze Dweomer (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, a Pathfinder savant can use <em>analyze dweomer</em> for up to 1 round per class level per day. He can use this ability in 1-round increments.<br /><br /><strong> Silence Master (Su)</strong>: A 6th-level Pathfinder savant can to activate spell-trigger, spell-completion, and command-word items silently, substituting a magical gesture for the necessary words. He cannot use this ability in circumstances where he could not cast a spell with somatic components. He must know how to activate the item normally for this ability to work. Three times per day, he can cast a spell of 6th level or lower as if he were using a <em>silent metamagic rod</em>.<br /><br /><strong> Dispelling Master (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, if the Pathfinder savant prepares and casts spells like a wizard, he can spontaneously convert any 3rd-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into <em>dispel magic</em> or any 6th-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into <em>greater dispel magic</em>, as a good-aligned cleric converts prepared spells into cure spells. If he casts spells spontaneously, he adds <em>dispel magic</em> and <em>greater dispel magic</em> to his list of spells known. Every time he successfully uses either of these spells to make a targeted dispel or counterspell, he heals a number of hit points equal to the caster level of the effect dispelled or counterspelled.<br /><br /><strong> Symbol Master (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a Pathfinder savant gains power over magical symbol spells (such as <em>symbol of death</em>). When he casts any symbol spell, the save DC to resist its effects, the Perception DC to notice the symbol, and the Disable Device DC to remove the symbol increase by 2. Once per day as an immediate action, the Pathfinder savant can double the bonus granted by his sigil master ability when he attempts a saving throw against a symbol. He can activate this ability after he rolls the saving throw, but must do so before the results are revealed. A Pathfinder savant does not automatically fail a saving throw against a symbol effect on a natural 1.<br /><br /><strong> Spellcasting Master (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a Pathfinder savant can focus his mind three times per day as a swift action. Once he&rsquo;s focused in this way, any spells he casts for the remainder of that round do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Spells with a duration of concentration that he casts in this round persist for a number of rounds after the Pathfinder savant ceases concentrating equal to his Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).<br /><br /><strong> Item Master (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Pathfinder savant can spend an hour focusing his energies on a single noncharged magic item that requires an action to activate. At the end of this hour, that item becomes attuned to the Pathfinder savant, and from that point on, that specific item can use the Pathfinder savant&rsquo;s caster level to resolve its effects rather than the item&rsquo;s caster level. A Pathfinder savant can change which item is attuned to him by repeating the attunement ritual, but he loses attunement to the previous item. A Pathfinder savant can have only one item attuned to him at a time.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oQdR1gVTmSurNHHK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Adept Activation (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QqknuJGO7y1FALsT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master Scholar (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.awYcmua0n6xx5lx7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Esoteric Magic (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1q0LFGYsYEDLiteT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Glyph-Finding (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TslKdhHgUeMZoBqg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Scroll Master (Su)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.BUP8hYzHOL6RJA7k","dataType":"compendium","name":"Quick Identification (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mznovwcbTMsYfx2u","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sigil Master (Su)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":5,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.j1M0NVPZw2wCZgZm","dataType":"compendium","name":"Analyze Dweomer (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":6,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.E8SQsaBKkEgaG4Ut","dataType":"compendium","name":"Silence Master (Su)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":6,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qNT13NYO2QF2HJtO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dispelling Master (Su)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":7,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.yclnN7drS5BsWm1d","dataType":"compendium","name":"Symbol Master (Su)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":8,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.dW3wUKKMqyp9bqq1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spellcasting Master (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":9,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zrUjDcih1TjjH9XJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Item Master (Su)","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","level":10,"_index":12}]},"tag":"pathfinderSavant","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Nature wardens befriend and train a beast of the wild as a companion, and some call wardens &ldquo;beastmasters&rdquo; because of these pets, but nature wardens are much more than tamers of wild things. They are experts at navigating the harsh brutality of nature's fury and making do with whatever tools and weapons present themselves, but they go beyond being hardy survivalists to become cunning tacticians with keen analytical minds, able to adapt and prepare for any situation and make the absolute best use of the advantages that any terrain or environment can afford them. <br /><br />Nature wardens are usually druids or ranger/druids, though occasional ranger/clerics with the Animal domain or even single-classed high-level rangers or multiclassed rangers explore this class. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: The nature warden is a master of wilderness environments and is at her most powerful in any of the variety of environments that she has studied. She and her animal companion form a potent team. They are excellent scouts and versatile warriors, able to supplement their skills with spells to fulfill almost any role. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Nature wardens tend toward nonevil alignments, as many pursue their profession out of a desire to help and protect others. Occasionally evil wardens can be found turning the bitter realities of the wild upon their enemies or guarding natural sites tainted by dark fey.</span></p>\n<h2

no proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a nature warden gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous caster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a nature warden, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Companion Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a nature warden's class levels stack with levels in all classes that grant an animal companion for the purpose of determining her animal companion's abilities. The nature warden and her animal companion have an empathic link like that between a wizard and his familiar. At 5th level, the nature warden's animal companion gains the same benefits the warden does when in the warden's favored terrain. <br /><br /><strong>Natural Empathy (Ex)</strong>: For the purpose of the wild empathy ability, a nature warden's class level stacks with levels in all classes with the wild empathy ability. When in her favored terrain, a nature warden adds her favored terrain bonus to wild empathy checks. She may also choose to use wild empathy to demoralize an animal or magical beast rather than improving its attitude, as if using Intimidate rather than Diplomacy. <br /><br />At 4th level, a nature warden no longer suffers a penalty when using wild empathy to influence or demoralize magical beasts. At 7th level, she may use wild empathy to affect vermin (whether mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2). At 10th level, she may use it to affect plant creatures (whether mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2). <br /><br /><strong>Mystic Harmony (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a nature warden in her favored terrain gains an insight bonus to AC equal to half her favored terrain bonus. She loses this bonus when she is immobilized or helpless. <br /><br /><strong>Wild Stride (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a nature warden and her animal companion gain the ability to move through natural hazards of her favored terrain (such as bogs, loose sand, snow, ice, rockslides, and so on) at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment (in effect, this is the woodland stride ability applied to non-plant environmental hazards). Terrain hazards that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her. <br /><br /><strong>Animal Speech (Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, a nature warden can <em>speak with animals </em>at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her favored terrain, she can use <em>speak with animals </em>once per day. Her caster level is equal to her class level. <br /><br /><strong>Silverclaw (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a nature warden's animal companion and any creature she summons with <em>summon nature's ally </em>gain DR/silver equal to the warden's class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. <br /><br /><strong>Favored Terrain (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level and again at 10th level, a nature warden may choose a favored terrain. This ability is identical to and stacks with the ranger class ability. <br /><br /><strong>Survivalist (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a nature warden suffers no penalty for using an improvised weapon or improvised tool. At 10th level, a warden can spend 1 minute examining and adjusting an improvised weapon or tool; thereafter she treats it as a masterwork weapon or tool. <br /><br /><strong>Woodforging (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, a nature warden can manufacture wooden items which she may use with surpassing skill. Once per day, she may use <em>wood shape </em>as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to her nature warden level. In her hands, items created with this ability are treated as masterwork items under the effect of an <em>ironwood </em>spell; in the hands of others, they are merely ordinary wooden items of the appropriate type. If the warden uses this ability to create armor or weapons, she may craft them into magic items as if she had the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat (though they are merely magical wood in the hands of others, and only ironwood when she uses them). <br /><br /><strong>Companion Walk (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, the nature warden's companion shares the benefits of travel spells (such as <em>tree stride </em>and <em>transport via plants</em>) and polymorph and similar spells (including <em>tree shape</em>) cast by the warden from the druid or ranger spell list. The companion counts either as part of the warden or as an object with no weight, whichever is more favorable for the warden. <br /><br /><strong>Plant Speech (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, a nature warden can cast speak with plants at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her favored terrain, she can use <em>speak with plants </em>once per day as a spell-like ability. Her caster level is equal to her class level. <br /><br /><strong>Ironpaw (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a nature warden may grant her animal companion and any creature she summons with <em>summon nature's ally </em>DR/cold iron equal to her class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This ability does not stack with the silverclaw ability. The warden must decide at the time of summoning whether a summoned creature gains the benefits of silverclaw or ironpaw. She may change which ability applies to her animal companion by spending 1 hour in prayer and meditation with the companion within 100 feet. <br /><br /><strong>Guarded Lands (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a nature warden may designate an area as her guarded lands, allowing her to treat it as her favored terrain or to enhance her bonuses if it is already in her favored terrain. The area must be no larger than 1 square mile, and the warden must spend 24 hours carefully studying the entire area. This period of study gives her a +2 favored terrain bonus in that area, which stacks with any favored terrain bonus for that area (for example, she also gets her forest favored terrain bonus if her guarded lands are part of a forest). She may also designate one creature type as her favored enemy within those guarded lands, gaining a +2 favored enemy bonus against the creature type that stacks with any favored enemy bonus she has against that type of creature. Allies who can see and hear the warden gain an initiative bonus equal to half the warden's favored terrain bonus for that terrain. <br /><br />A nature warden may have a number of guarded lands equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). When she reaches her maximum number of guarded lands, she can select a new guarded land by abandoning an existing one and performing the ritual for a new area. <br /><br /><strong>Companion Soul (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a nature warden's bond with her animal companion is so strong that it transcends distance and even death. The companion's devotion ability increases to a +8 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. The warden may scry on her animal companion once per day as if using the <em>scrying </em>spell, except she needs no focus or divine focus. She may view the area around her companion or see through its eyes. If her companion dies, she can revive it with an 8-hour ritual; this has the same effect as <em>raise dead</em>, except it doesn't require a material component and the companion does not gain any negative levels from the ordeal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.w4aCw7DblqVuSfkq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Companion Bond (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3wXA6AJkqszztO0e","dataType":"compendium","name":"Natural Empathy (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.0fTqdeF3IPAGg7oQ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mystic Harmony (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8sJ7pevmPcNp9TDl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wild Stride (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.iu1bWa1gesZkMOEL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Animal Speech (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kvuxSyv3QMQlPnME","dataType":"compendium","name":"Silverclaw (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.K0I1A8i2fdIjhsYc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favored Terrain (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":5,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cyFBMDaTm8oGGIiG","dataType":"compendium","name":"Survivalist (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":5,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WXXdAw7okLKxurhD","dataType":"compendium","name":"Woodforging (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":6,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.UYEeB99FEVi5bUEN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Companion Walk (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":7,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SY96O48qbFnXat9N","dataType":"compendium","name":"Plant Speech (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":7,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.woNYqzlTSHOo5Sgo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ironpaw (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":8,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.bUvLzUXeeJhHIJyF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Guarded Lands (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":9,"_index":12},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.T8jF1LURViyIo56i","dataType":"compendium","name":"Companion Soul (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_01.jpg","level":10,"_index":13}]},"tag":"natureWarden","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They seek magic in all of its forms, finding no reason or logic in denying themselves instruction by limiting their knowledge to one stifling paradigm, though many are simply hungry for limitless power. No matter what their motivations, mystic theurges believe that perception is reality, and through the divine forces and astral energies of the multiverse, that perception can be used to manipulate and control not only the nature of this reality, but destiny itself. <br /><br />Mystic theurges are drawn from multiclass spellcasters who can already cast both arcane and divine spells, and the powers that they gain increase their mastery over both. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: The mystic theurge is a powerful component for any party, supplying magic for attack, defense, and healing. Mystic theurges travel the world in search of arcane and holy artifacts, magical lore, or divine revelations, and most have no qualms about teaming up with groups of adventurers so long as that group's goals do not directly conflict with their own. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: The motivations of a mystic theurge rarely stem from a sense of altruism or philanthropy, so most tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. Lawful mystic theurges, whether good, neutral, or evil, are rarer, and often use their powers for either the benefit&mdash;or control&mdash;of society. Chaotic mystic theurges are rarer still, as the calling generally requires great personal discipline.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a mystic theurge, a

class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Mystic theurges gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in any one arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class and any one divine spellcasting class he belonged to previously. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of mystic theurge to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class and divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a mystic theurge, he must decide to which class he adds each level of mystic theurge for the purpose of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Combined Spells (Su)</strong>: A mystic theurge can prepare and cast spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the available slots from any of his other spellcasting classes. Spells prepared or cast in this way take up a slot one level higher than they originally occupied. This ability cannot be used to cast a spell at a lower level if that spell exists on both spell lists. At 1st level, a mystic theurge can prepare 1st-level spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the 2nd-level slots of the other spellcasting class. Every two levels thereafter, the level of spells that can be cast in this way increases by one, to a maximum of 5th-level spells at 9th level (these spells would take up 6th-level spell slots). The components of these spells do not change, but they otherwise follow the rules for the spellcasting class used to cast the spell. <br /><br />Spontaneous spellcasters can only select spells that they have prepared that day using non-spontaneous classes for this ability, even if the spells have already been cast. For example, a cleric/sorcerer/mystic theurge can use this ability to spontaneously cast a <em>bless </em>spell using a 2nd-level sorcerer spell slot, if the character had a prepared <em>bless </em>spell using a 1st-level cleric spell slot, even if that spell had already been cast that day. <br /><br /><strong>Spell Synthesis (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a mystic theurge can cast two spells, one from each of his spellcasting classes, using one action. Both of the spells must have the same casting time. The mystic theurge can make any decisions concerning the spells independently. Any target affected by both of the spells takes a &ndash;2 penalty on saves made against each spell. The mystic theurge receives a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance with these two spells. A mystic theurge may use this ability once per day.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8fwJFI5R6elcxfJR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Combined Spells (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/emerald_09.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.dIJpWIT8I9BrQAfz","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spell Synthesis (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/emerald_09.jpg","level":10,"_index":1}]},"tag":"mysticTheurge","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Proficiency</strong>: An esoteric knight is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, an esoteric knight gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a psychic spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one psychic spellcasting class before becoming an esoteric knight, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br />Instead of choosing a spellcasting class, a character with levels in a class that grants the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Kineticist\">kinetic blast</a> class feature can add these effective levels to that class. If she does, she increases her effective kineticist level for purposes of determining the highest level of wild talents she can select, the effective spell level of her kinetic blast and defense wild talents, and the amount of burn she can accept each round. She continues to gain utility wild talents and infusions as if these levels of esoteric knight were levels of her class that grants kinetic blast. She does not gain or increase other related class features, such as infusion specializations. <br /><br /><strong>Martial Esoterica</strong>: At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the esoteric knight gains a bonus combat feat. She must meet the prerequisites of the feat. Her esoteric knight levels count as fighter levels and stack with any levels of fighter she might have for meeting the prerequisites for feats.<br /><br />An esoteric knight can learn a new combat feat in place of the most recent martial esoterica feat she has learned either by expending a 1st-level spell slot or, if she is a character with the burn class feature (such as the kineticist), by accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action. In effect, the esoteric knight loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent combat feat gained. Whenever she gains a new bonus combat feat, the previous feat becomes set and cannot be changed again. <br /><br /><strong>Psychic Esoterica</strong>: As an esoteric knight gains experience, she learns a number of psychic esoterica that enhance her offensive and defensive capabilities. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an esoteric knight gains one psychic esoterica. Each esoterica can be selected only once.<br /><br />Some esoterica require a character to expend one or more spell slots to activate. A character with the burn class feature (such as a kineticist) can accept burn instead of expending spell slots. She can accept 1 point of burn instead of expending a 1st-level or lower spell slot, or 2 points of burn instead of expending a 3rd-level or lower spell slot. <br /><br /><em>Battle Mind (Su)</em>: By expending a 1st-level spell slot as a free action while casting a spell or using a kinetic blast, the esoteric knight can cast the spell as if it were modified by the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Intuitive%20Spell\">Intuitive Spell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Logical%20Spell\">Logical Spell</a> feats or grant the kinetic blast the benefits of the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot\">Point-Blank Shot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Precise%20Shot\">Precise Shot</a> feats. <br /><br /><em>Confounding Projection (Su)</em>: By expending a 1st-level spell slot as a swift action, an esoteric knight can project a duplicate of herself into the mind of an enemy within 30 feet for 1 round. This duplicate appears to the enemy to occupy an adjacent space and grants the esoteric knight the benefits of flanking, even against enemies who are normally immune to flanking. This is a mind-affecting effect. <br /><br /><em>Eldritch Armor (Su)</em>: When wearing armor or using a shield, the esoteric knight adds 1 point of her Intelligence or Charisma bonus (if any; whichever is higher) per esoteric knight class level as an enhancement bonus to her armor or shield (maximum +5). The esoteric knight can forgo 1 point of enhancement bonus per ability to instead grant the benefit of the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Glamered\"><em>glamered</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shadow\"><em>shadow</em></a>, or <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Slick\"><em>slick</em></a> armor special abilities.<br /><br />Each day when regaining spell slots, the esoteric knight can adjust these benefits and can transfer them to a different armor or shield; the benefits cease to function if the esoteric knight is not wearing the armor or wielding the shield. <br /><br /><em>Eldritch Weapon (Su)</em>: By expending a 1stlevel spell slot as a swift action, the esoteric knight can grant a magic weapon she is wielding any one of the following special abilities for 1 minute: <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Defending\"><em>defending</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flaming\"><em>flaming</em>, </a><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Frost\"><em>frost</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Keen\"><em>keen</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Merciful\"><em>merciful</em></a>, or <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shock\"><em>shock</em></a>. This benefit stacks with (but cannot duplicate) any existing weapon enhancements. The esoteric knight can alternatively cause the weapon to be treated as cold iron or silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction for 1 minute. <br /><br /><em>Phantom&rsquo;s Armory (Su)</em>: By expending a 2nd-level spell slot as a swift action, the esoteric knight can cause her attacks (whether weapon attacks or kinetic blasts) and her armor to be treated as <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch\"><em>ghost touch</em> weapons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch\">armor</a> for 1 minute, regardless of weapon or armor type or any other abilities modifying the weapons and armor.<br /><br /><em>Shadow Projection (Su)</em>: By expending a 3rd-level spell slot as a standard action, the esoteric knight can summon a phantom ally resembling herself. This ability functions as the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shadowdancer\">shadowdancer&rsquo;s summon shadow</a> ability except that the summoned creature remains for 1 minute per esoteric knight level, and there is no penalty for the creature&rsquo;s death or dismissal. <br /><br /><em>Step through Reality (Sp)</em>: By expending a 3rd-level spell slot as a swift action, the esoteric knight can teleport to a space within 30 feet as if using <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=dimension%20door\"><em>dimension door</em></a>. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The esoteric knight cannot bring other creatures with her.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.W3aK5Pa4aWpO0PKo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Martial Esoterica","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/kusari-gusoku.png","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.xpwbEInVsiGtH403","dataType":"compendium","name":"Psychic Esoterica","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/kusari-gusoku.png","level":2,"_index":1}]},"tag":"esotericKnight","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

During their uniquely personal journeys, they learn how to interpret signs and portents that allow them to make uncannily accurate predications about possible actions for themselves and others. Over time, as they forge ever-deeper connections with their past lives and approach an ultimate state of oneness with the world around them, they develop the capacity to manifest the abilities and eventually the actual forms of many different animals. Eventually, Brightness Seekers even gain the power to shrug off death itself should it interfere with their quest for enlightenment, and their ability to reincarnate themselves with their memories intact offers them a chance to eventually reclaim their original form.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Brightness Seeker, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Feat</strong>: Iron Will<br /><strong>Race</strong>: Elf<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Spot 4 ranks, Survival 4 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 4 ranks and Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks (or vice versa).</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Brightness Seeker's class skills are Climb, Concentration, Craft, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Heal, Hide, Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (religion), Listen, Profession, Spot, Survival, Swim.<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.7291%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.7291%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Discover omen, favored pilgrim</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.7291%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Channel past incarnation, tranquility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.7291%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Common ground, wild shape 1/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.7291%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">One with nature, tranquility aura</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.7291%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Rebirth, wild shape 2/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Brightness Seeker prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Discover Omen (Su)</strong>: All Brightness Seekers know how to interpret the omens the natural world presents to them in order to discover lucky or unlucky actions for themselves and others. Once per day per class level, a Brightness Seeker may attempt to forecast the future of herself or a creature within 30 ft.<br /><br />Searching for an omen takes 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation; the Brightness Seeker rolls 1d20 and adds her class level and Charisma modifier to determine the omen check result. She may add a +3 to her roll if she knows the target&rsquo;s birthday and birth month, the target&rsquo;s true name or birth name, or his city of birth (or similarly specific geographic area); these bonuses stack if she knows more than one of these things. If the check result is 20 or higher, she learns an omen regarding that creature&rsquo;s next 24 hours. She may perform multiple forecasts for the same creature if the initial check fails to reveal an omen, but once she achieves a result, she cannot forecast for that creature again until a day has passed.<br /><br />A creature who knows his omen may utilize a onetime insight bonus equal to the Brightness Seeker&rsquo;s class level. This bonus may be used on any single attack roll, ability check, skill check, or saving throw made by the creature. Alternatively, he can apply the insight bonus to his AC against a single attack targeting them (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn&rsquo;t take an action; the character can even activate the bonus on another creature&rsquo;s turn if needed. The character must choose to use this bonus before making the roll it is to modify. Once used, the effect of the omen ends.<br /><br /><strong>Favored Pilgrim (Ex)</strong>: Most elves revere Brightness Seekers, and will often do whatever they can to help them complete their personal journeys through their current incarnations. Elves who believe in the Brightness who normally would have an initial attitude of hostile, unfriendly, or indifferent toward the character instead start as one step closer to friendly when dealing with the character.<br /><br /><strong>Channel Past Incarnation (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, Brightness Seekers establish a mystical connection with their previous lives spent as simple creatures of the forest or field. Once per day, a Brightness Seeker may spend 1 hour meditating to manifest one of the special qualities detailed below. This special quality remains for 1 day or until the Brightness Seeker changes form or dismisses it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bite and claws (1d6 points of damage each)</li>\n<li>Blindsense 30 ft. (sound-based, like a bat)</li>\n<li>Darkvision 60 ft.</li>\n<li>Scent</li>\n<li>Temperature-adapted (as <em>endure elements</em>)</li>\n<li>Thick hide (+3 natural armor bonus to AC)</li>\n<li>Waterborn (swim speed 40 ft., can breathe water and air)</li>\n<li>Wings (average maneuverability, fly speed 40 ft.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tranquility (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, Brightness Seekers awaken memories of their past incarnations and realize that even death is merely a threshold to another existence rather than something to be feared. They gain a +10 resistance bonus on saves against fear effects.<br /><br /><strong>Common Ground (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, Brightness Seekers discover ways to make natural creatures accept them as kindred spirits. They gain the wild empathy ability; to use this ability they roll 1d20 and add their class level and Charisma bonus. This ability stacks with class levels from classes that also provide wild empathy.<br /><br /><strong>Wild Shape (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, Brightness Seekers develop an even stronger capacity to call upon the forms of their prior animal incarnations, which manifests as the ability to wild shape as a druid once per day. At 5th level, this increases to twice per day. If a Brightness Seeker has the ability to wild shape from another class, the uses per day stack. Class levels in Brightness Seeker stack with druid levels and other class levels that grant wild shape for the purpose of determining what size and type of creature the character can change into.<br /><br /><strong>One With Nature (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, a Brightness Seeker forms a personal relationship with the living world. Brightness Seekers may cast <em>commune with nature</em> as a spell-like ability usable at will (though it still requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to activate, just like the spell).<br /><br /><strong>Tranquility Aura (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, all friendly creatures within a 10-foot radius of a Brightness Seeker gain a +10 resistance bonus on saves against fear effects.<br /><br /><strong>Rebirth (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, Brightness Seekers gain the ability to return from the grave if they die through violence or any other sort of unnatural end. A slain Brightness Seeker may activate this ability any time between 10 minutes and 1 week after death occurs, at which point their soul reincarnates in the form of a healthy adult animal the same size as the previous body and of a type common to where the previous body died. The character&rsquo;s ability scores do not change, but she gains all abilities associated with her new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like. The character gains a negative level, which cannot be removed by any means, but goes away automatically when the character achieves a new experience level or dies. This ability doesn&rsquo;t work if the character was killed by a death effect or she was turned into an undead creature.<br /><br />Each time a Brightness Seeker in animal form gains a new experience level, she may attempt a DC 20 Will save; success means she regains her previous race and appearance. If a Brightness Seeker is killed in animal form, she cannot use this ability to reincarnate again, though normal methods of reviving the dead still work. A <em>miracle</em> or <em>wish</em> can restore a living or dead animal Brightness Seeker&rsquo;s original form (and bring her back to life, if dead).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9H0XqVPPLL8evAIc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Channel Past Incarnation (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EhMmOTnGtxLao39m","dataType":"compendium","name":"Common Ground (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4CRG01ToTzYLNx1d","dataType":"compendium","name":"Discover Omen (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oH1nFWeUNOqCiueE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favored Pilgrim (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.dp8MEft2WJHEyarb","dataType":"compendium","name":"One With Nature (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Hf44EdU7lTtaSslZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Rebirth (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SUndpZLwj3xJcr2g","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tranquility (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":2,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.UEq1FHsuN6zIKXYW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tranquility Aura (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":4,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Hb4zDjETKqPgETlE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wild Shape (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/fetchling.png","level":3,"_index":8}]},"tag":"brightnessSeeker","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Brightness Seeker","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They prefer to fight in crowded urban areas and are masters of motion, controlling both their own movement and those around them. With the flick of a blade, they can slow their enemies to a crawl and then step into a crowd and disappear from sight. Lion Blades are typically recruited out of the famous bardic colleges of Oppara, as the Shadow Schools want intelligent, flexible trainees. A Lion Blade usually spends at least a year in training before taking on missions for the Taldan Empire and various non-governmental organizations. Lion Blade PCs are often on extended loan for a specific purpose or given permission to adventure in order to perfect their art in real-world settings.

the class features of the Lion Blade prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A Lion Blades gains no proficiency with any weapons or armor.<br /><br /><strong>Bardic Performance</strong>: The Lion Blade adds her class level to any other levels in classes that grant the bardic performance ability to determine the effects of her bardic performance but not for the purpose of gaining access to new bardic performances. She also learns the following performances.<br /><br /><em>Inspiring Poise (Ex)</em>: A Lion Blade gains a +2 competence bonus on checks with a skill of her choice for as long as she maintains the performance. The bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and +6 at 9th level. The performance is ended by any condition that imposes a penalty to her Dexterity score or immobilizes her.<br /><br /><em>Dirge of Misfortune (Su)</em>: A Lion Blade of 5th level or higher can use her performance to break the concentration of her enemies, causing them to fail even at simple tasks. Once per round as an immediate action, as long as the Lion Blade continues performing, she can force a creature within 30 feet to reroll any d20 roll it just made before the effects are applied. The opponent must use the result of the reroll, which has a &ndash;2 penalty. Dirge of misfortune is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and visual components.<br /><br /><strong>Master of Disguise (Ex)</strong>: A Lion Blade takes no penalties on Disguise checks to change her gender, race, or age.<br /><br /><strong>Move with the Crowd (Ex)</strong>: When moving through groups of intelligent Small, Medium, or Large creatures that would normally count as difficult terrain, the Lion Blade instead moves normally. In addition, she gains a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity or move through an enemy&rsquo;s square when moving faster than half speed.<br /><br /><strong>Slowing Strike (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, once per round upon successfully hitting a target with a sneak attack, a Lion Blade can choose to deal 1 fewer die of sneak attack damage and instead reduce one of the target&rsquo;s speeds by 5 feet. Once a target&rsquo;s speed has been reduced to 0 feet, it is immobilized (but not helpless). A target&rsquo;s fly speed can be reduced this way only if it uses wings to fly. The movement penalties imposed by slowing strike can be removed by healing the affected target to full hit points or a <em>lesser restoration</em> spell.<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Lion Blade gains sneak attack +1d6, as the rogue ability. This extra damage increases by 1d6 at both 6th level and 10th level. These increases stack with sneak attack damage granted by other sources.<br /><br /><strong>Unexpected Suggestion (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, once per day, a Lion Blade can use <em>suggestion</em> on a flat-footed target. Her caster level is equal to her Lion Blade level. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Lion Blade&rsquo;s ranks in Bluff + her Intelligence modifier.<br /><br /><strong>Hide in the Crowd (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Lion Blade can use the Stealth skill even when the only cover she has is that provided by other creatures.<br /><br /><strong>Expeditious Advance (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a Lion Blade&rsquo;s land speed is faster than normal for her race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor or light armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the Lion Blade&rsquo;s speed because of any load carried or armor worn.<br /><br /><strong>Perfect Surprise (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a Lion Blade can deliver a devastating blow to anyone she catches unaware. Whenever she hits a foe with a sneak attack at the end of a charge or while using Spring Attack, she can make the blow a perfect surprise as an immediate action. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the Lion Blade&rsquo;s class level + her Intelligence modifier) or fall unconscious for 1 round per Lion Blade level. Once targeted by this ability, a victim is immune to perfect surprise for 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong>Crowd Strike (Ex)</strong>: When a Lion Blade reaches 6th level, all crowd squares (<em>Core Rulebook 436</em>) count as enemies threatening adjacent squares for the purpose of determining whether the Lion Blade is flanking an opponent. In addition, she can use the Stealth skill to snipe at foes even when making melee attacks as long as she attacks from a square containing at least one other creature within one size category of her.<br /><br /><strong>Secret Step (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a Lion Blade&rsquo;s movement through crowds that would normally be difficult terrain costs only half as many squares of movement as normal. In addition, the Acrobatics bonus she gains from move with the crowd increases to +10.<br /><br /><strong>Cloud the Mind (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, whenever a Lion Blade&rsquo;s opposed Disguise or Stealth check is exceeded by one or more observers&rsquo; Perception checks, she can trick the observers into thinking they imagined noticing anything wrong as an immediate action. She attempts a Bluff check opposed by the targets&rsquo; Sense Motive checks. Each target who fails this opposed check ignores the fact that he saw her. The Lion Blade also gains an amount of spell resistance equal to 10 + her class level against divination spells. If a spell is foiled by her spell resistance, she learns the spell&rsquo;s normal effect and can choose a substitute result for the divination rather than causing it to obviously fail.<br /><br /><strong>Narrow Miss (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a Lion Blade can dodge erratically as a swift action, gaining 20% concealment until her next turn. She can use this ability once per day for every 2 Lion Blade levels she has.<br /><br /><strong>Grandmaster of Disguise (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a Lion Blade can improvise a disguise using materials on hand that is as effective as one crafted using an actual disguise kit. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks (this does not stack with the bonus from an actual disguise kit). She can attempt a Disguise check at a &ndash;20 penalty to create a disguise as a full-round action.<br /><br /><strong>Silent Soul (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a Lion Blade has mastered the ability to still her thoughts and her movements to an amazing degree. The Lion Blade gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. She also gains spell resistance 20 against mind-affecting effects. If a spell is foiled by her spell resistance, she learns the spell&rsquo;s normal effect and can make it appear as if she were affected by it rather than causing it to obviously fail. If the spell provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but she can disregard whichever commands she desires.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige

gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Inspiring Command (Ex)</strong>: A battle herald uses her keen tactical acumen and decisive judgment to lead others to victory, as well as her mastery of command to assist herself and her allies in battle. <br /><br />All battle heralds may use inspiring command to inspire courage (as the bardic performance ability); bard and battle herald levels stack to determine the bonuses provided by inspire courage. <br /><br />At 1st level, and every two levels thereafter, the battle herald chooses one command to learn. Unless otherwise noted, these abilities provide a competence bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to her and to all allies within 60 feet able to see or hear her. Commands marked with an asterisk have the same range as above but only affect a certain number of allies (which can include the battle herald). <br /><br />Issuing an inspiring command is a move action. At 5th level, this becomes a swift action, and at 10th level, it becomes an immediate action. Maintaining an inspiring command is a free action that cannot be disrupted, but its effects end immediately if the battle herald is killed or otherwise prevented from taking actions (such as being dazed, helpless, or stunned). The battle herald cannot have more than one command in effect at a time. She may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Charisma modifier, plus 2 additional rounds per level after 1st. She may use rounds of bardic performance to issue inspiring commands, but not vice versa. Inspiring commands are language-dependent, mind-affecting effects. The battle herald cannot maintain an inspiring command and a bardic performance at the same time (this does not preclude abilities such as persistent command or the Lingering Performance feat, which continue an inspiring command or bardic performance after the battle herald stops maintaining it). <br /><br /><em>Battle Magic</em>*: One ally gains a bonus on caster level checks and concentration checks equal to the battle herald's command bonus. <br /><br /><em>Inspire Hardiness</em>: Allies gain DR/&mdash; equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. <br /><br /><em>Inspired Tactics</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls, on combat maneuver checks, and as a dodge bonus to AC against any attacks of opportunity provoked by combat maneuvers. <br /><br /><em>Keep Your Heads</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus on Will saves and concentration checks. <br /><br /><em>None Shall Fall</em>*: A number of allies equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus heal 1d6 points of damage. Targeted allies who are poisoned may attempt a new poison saving throw with a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus; a failed save has no additional effect, but a successful save counts toward curing the poison. This healing is not positive energy and can heal undead creatures. <br /><br /><em>Pincer Maneuver</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to attack and damage rolls when flanking and as a dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement (including standing from prone). <br /><br /><em>Rally</em>: Allies affected by a fear effect may attempt a new saving throw against each fear effect on them; this new save has a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. <br /><br /><em>Reveille</em>: Allies affected by exhaustion, fatigue, or sleep effects may attempt a new saving throw against each such effect; this new save has a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. Allies who are sleeping normally automatically awaken when this ability is used. <br /><br /><em>Scatter</em>*: A number of allies equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus gain the benefits of the Wind Stance feat. <br /><br /><em>Shake It Off</em>*: One ally subject to an ongoing condition may attempt a new saving throw to negate the effects with a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. This ability does not help against instantaneous effects, effects that require recurring saving throws to avoid additional penalties (such as diseases and poisons), or effects that do not allow a saving throw. <br /><br /><em>Sound the Charge</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to attack and damage rolls. Charging allies increase their speed by 5 feet times the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. <br /><br /><em>Sound the Retreat</em>: Allies gain the benefit of the Lightning Stance feat. The battle herald must have the scatter ability to select this ability. <br /><br /><em>Stand Firm</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus to CMD and on Fortitude saves. <br /><br /><em>Teamwork</em>: Allies add the battle herald's inspiring command bonus on skill checks or attack rolls made when using the aid another action, and if successful, the assisted ally increases the aid another bonus by an amount equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. <br /><br /><em>Tuck and Roll</em>: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command bonus on Reflex saves and Acrobatics checks. <br /><br /><strong>Improved Leadership (Ex)</strong>: A battle herald with the Leadership feat adds her inspiring command bonus to her leadership score. <br /><br /><strong>Voice of Authority (Ex)</strong>: A battle herald is skilled at shouting commands over the din of the battlefield and signaling allies when speech is impossible. She gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks with creatures with which she shares a language. In addition, her allies gain a bonus equal to the battle herald's class level on Perception or Sense Motive checks to hear her commands or interpret her secret messages conveyed with Bluff. The battle herald's levels stack with cavalier levels for the purpose of the cavalier's tactician ability. <br /><br /><strong>Easy March (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, allies within 60 feet of the battle herald can hustle or force march during overland travel without ill effects for a number of hours per day equal to 1 hour times her inspiring command bonus. <br /><br /><strong>Inspire Greatness (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a battle herald may use her inspiring command ability to inspire greatness (as the 9th-level bardic performance ability). This ability affects one creature at 4th level, two at 7th, and three at 10th. <br /><br /><strong>Banner (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a battle herald may fly a battle standard that inspires her allies. This ability is identical to the cavalier's banner ability, and cavalier levels stack with battle herald levels to determine the bonuses provided by the banner. <br /><br /><strong>Teamwork Feat</strong>: At 6th level, a battle herald receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this feat. She can use her cavalier tactician ability as a move action to grant this feat to allies (if she has the cavalier greater tactician ability, this is a swift action). <br /><br /><strong>Demanding Challenge (Ex)</strong>: This ability is identical to the 12th-level cavalier demanding challenge ability. <br /><br /><strong>Persistent Commands (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, a battle herald may allow her inspiring commands to persist even if she is incapacitated and unable to maintain them. If the player chooses, the effects of the battle herald's inspiring commands persist for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (these count toward her number of rounds per day limit). This ability does not apply if the battle herald intentionally stops maintaining an inspiring command&mdash;only if she is dazed, held, stunned, killed, and so on, and is unable to maintain them. If the battle herald recovers from incapacity while an inspiring command is ongoing, she may resume maintaining it as a free action. <br /><br /><strong>Inspire Last Stand (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a battle herald may use inspiring command to grant herself and all allies within 30 feet the benefits of the Diehard feat. Conscious affected creatures also gain the benefits of inspire courage while at negative hit points. <br /><br /><strong>Complex Commands (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a battle herald can have more than one command ability in effect at one time. Each must be begun separately and requires a separate maintenance cost. This allows the battle herald to have more than one single-target command (such as battle magic) in effect at the same time. The effects of multiple instances of the same command ability do not stack, even if the bonuses provided by that ability would normally stack (for example, if the battle herald maintains two pincer maneuver commands, her allies do not get double the bonus, even though dodge bonuses normally stack). <br /><br />The battle herald can also maintain one bardic performance in addition to her inspiring commands, though each must be begun separately and each requires its own maintenance cost.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.OOLBobcnnYO3U1LC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Banner (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":5,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.o9uY8wovF1tF6S9G","dataType":"compendium","name":"Easy March (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NrVxHfdAZmAJoiKh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Leadership (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gCO2wTkJPhOlWg68","dataType":"compendium","name":"Inspire Greatness (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":4,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.OXqXHkLtNi5Tsg4c","dataType":"compendium","name":"Inspire Last Stand (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":9,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zg6ReTqyzGwVgS4k","dataType":"compendium","name":"Inspiring Command (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IqXnJQyvUwxe95hT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Persistent Commands (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":8,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rCSJaGsJ5e8IBr2g","dataType":"compendium","name":"Voice of Authority (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":1,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.svh4eyF7dZvXmSTd","dataType":"compendium","name":"Demanding Challenge (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":7,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.VbG5htrfN63TP5AN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Complex Commands (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":10,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Z1FdvYXcK9UKHLc4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Teamwork Feat","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-symbol-axe-red.webp","level":6,"_index":10}]},"tag":"battleHerald","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":true,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Battle Herald","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

For a few alchemists, that price is transformation into a master chymist, a creature able to take a monstrous brute form as an act of will. <br /><br />Master chymists become two personalities sharing a single body. Both the hulking &ldquo;mutagenic form&rdquo; of alchemical prowess and the original alchemist who created it think of themselves as the true form, and they must learn to work together to achieve their joint goals. More often than not, master chymists eventually become their mutagenic form, and the original alchemist's body and mind may only be brought forth when required by social custom or a need for obscurity and stealth arises. Unfortunately, the mutagenic form of a master chymist is often a more violent, unforgiving personality (which can lead to conflict between the two versions of the same character). <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Master chymists are rarely accepted by society once their nature is revealed, and thus they have a strong motivation to keep on the move. Adventuring is one of the few activities that their monstrous form can be useful for, leading many to constantly explore dangerous areas on the edge of civilization. A master chymist's resilience and ability to combine bomb-throwing mayhem with up-close melee carnage is a great benefit to many adventuring parties, buying the master chymist allies who are at least willing to overlook her more distasteful features. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: A master chymist actually has two alignments (see the mutagenic form ability). The only restriction on these alignments is that they cannot be exactly the same.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a master chymist, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Spells</strong>: Ability to create 3rd-level extracts. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: Mutagen class feature, feral mutagen or infuse mutagen discovery.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Master Chymist's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Str).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\"><strong>Spells Per Day</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Bomb-thrower, mutagenic form, mutate 2/day</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Advanced mutagen</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">+1 level of alchemist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Brutality (+2)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">+1 level of alchemist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Advanced mutagen</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Mutate 3/day</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">+1 level of alchemist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Advanced mutagen</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">+1 level of alchemist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Brutality (+4)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">+1 level of alchemist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Advanced mutagen, mutate 4/day</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Brutality (+6)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">+1 level of alchemist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.3348%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.8026%;\">Advanced mutagen, mutate 5/day</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.3184%;\">+1 level of alchemist</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the master chymist prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A master chymist gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Extracts per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a master chymist gains new extracts per day as if she had also gained a level in alchemist. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for extracts per day and an increased effective caster level for extracts. <br /><br /><strong>Bomb-Thrower (Ex)</strong>: The destructive power of bombs appeals to the violent urges of a master chymist. Add the character's alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine the damage done by her bombs. <br /><br /><strong>Mutagenic Form (Ex)</strong>: A master chymist's mutagenic form is an alter ego that has a different personality than her normal form, an outgrowth of the mental changes caused by the mutagenic potions she has consumed over the course of her career. The mutagenic form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist's normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a different manner. The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous and may even appear to be a different race or gender than her normal form; they may look as different as two unrelated people. Indeed, the mutagenic form often has his or her own name, and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and strongholds (though the alter ego's limited time in existence often makes this difficult). The mutagenic form even has his or her own alignment (which is selected by the player, but must be different from the master chymist's normal alignment). The change in alignment only affects the master chymist while in her mutagenic form. <br /><br /><em>Example</em>: Darabont is a neutral good gnome alchemist 7/master chymist 4. Her mutagenic form is a deformed, twisted creature called Butcher. Butcher is neutral, and more interested in seeing the world kept in balance than promoting the greatest good. Butcher is aware she exists only when called on by Darabont, but seeks to build her own circle of like-minded friends during the hours she exists. Butcher does not dislike Darabont, but feels her gnome form is too soft and innocent to survive in the harsh world the chymist lives in. As Darabont, the character detects as good and is affected as a good character by spells with effects that vary by alignment; as Butcher, the same character is neutral, is not revealed by a detect good spell, and is treated as neutral for all spells and effects. <br /><br /><strong>Mutate (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, as a result of repeated exposure to her mutagens, the master chymist can now assume a mutagenic form twice per day without imbibing her mutagen. In this form, she gains all the bonuses and penalties of her mutagen and adds together her alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine her effective alchemist level for the duration of this form. Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in her mutagenic form works normally (with the new mutagen's modifiers replacing the current modifiers, and the longer duration taking precedent). The chymist remains in her mutagenic form until its duration expires, her magic is interrupted (as with an <em>antimagic field</em>), or she expends another use of her mutate ability. <br /><br />A chymist may be forced to take her mutagenic form against her will by stress or damage. Anytime the character is in her normal form and has daily uses of the mutate ability available, she may be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a Fortitude save. In these situations the chymist must make a DC 25 Will save; if she fails, on her next turn she uses a standard action to change to her mutagenic form (which counts as a use of the mutate ability). <br /><br />At 5th level, the master chymist can assume her mutagenic form three times per day; this increases to four times per day at 8th level and five times per day at 10th level. <br /><br /><strong>Advanced Mutagen (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, the mutagenic form of the master chymist continues to evolve and develop as she grows in power. The master chymist selects an advanced mutagen, a power that changes how her mutagen form works or can only be accessed in her mutagenic form. She gains additional advanced mutagens at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level. The chymist cannot select the same advanced mutagen more than once. <br /><br /><em>Burly (Ex)</em>: In her mutagenic form, the master chymist's heavy physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on Strength checks, Constitution checks, and Strength-based skill checks as well as a bonus to CMB and CMD. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level. <br /><br /><em>Disguise (Ex)</em>: When in her mutagenic form, the chymist can temporarily change her appearance to her normal form and still retain most of the abilities of her mutagenic form. As a standard action, she may make a Will saving throw (DC 20) to assume the appearance of her normal form for one minute. Each additional minute beyond the first requires a new saving throw with a +1 increase to the DC. Failure means the chymist assumes her normal form (as if ending the use of mutagenic form) or reverts fully to her mutagenic form. At any time while using this ability, the chymist can resume her normal form as a standard action or relax her will and revert to her mutagenic form as a free action. Once this ability ends, the chymist cannot use it again until 10 minutes have passed. Obvious physical changes in mutagenic form such as draconic mutagen, feral mutagen, and growth mutagen do not work while the chymist is disguised in her normal form. Time spent disguised counts toward the chymist's time in her mutagenic form. <br /><br /><em>Draconic Mutagen (Su)</em>: When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she gains dragon-like features&mdash;scaly skin, reptilian eyes, and so on, resembling a half-dragon. The chymist chooses one dragon type (see the draconic bloodline) when selecting this advanced mutagen; once selected, this choice cannot be changed and determines her draconic resistances and breath weapon type. The chymist gains resistance 20 to the dragon's energy type. The chymist's breath weapon deals 8d8 points of energy damage (Reflex half, DC 10 + the chymist's class level + the chymist's Intelligence modifier); she may use her breath weapon once per transformation into her mutagenic form. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16, must know the <em>form of the dragon I </em>extract, and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability. <br /><br /><em>Dual Mind (Ex)</em>: The chymist's alter ego gives her a +2 bonus on Will saving throws in her normal and mutagenic forms. If she is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC; if she succeeds, she is free of the effect (as if she had made her original save) and immediately changes to her mutagenic form or back to her normal form. If she has no more uses of the mutate ability remaining for the day, she cannot use dual mind. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 10 to select this ability. <br /><br /><em>Evasion (Ex)</em>: This mutagen functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except that it only applies in the chymist's mutagenic form. <br /><br /><em>Extended Mutagen (Ex)</em>: The duration of the master chymist's mutation is doubled. <br /><br /><em>Feral Mutagen (Ex)</em>: This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. <br /><br /><em>Furious Mutagen (Ex)</em>: The damage dice for the feral mutagen's bite and claw attacks increase by one die step. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 11 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability. <br /><br /><em>Grand Mutagen (Ex)</em>: This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability. <br /><br /><em>Greater Mutagen (Ex)</em>: This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 12 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability. <br /><br /><em>Growth Mutagen (Su)</em>: When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she increases one size category, as if under the effects of an <em>enlarge person </em>spell. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 16 and must know the <em>enlarge person</em>, <em>giant form I</em>, or polymorph extract to select this ability. <br /><br /><em>Night Vision (Ex)</em>: The chymist gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision in her mutagenic form. <br /><br /><em>Nimble (Ex)</em>: The master chymist's lithe physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on all Dexterity checks, Dexterity skill checks, and CMD, and a natural armor bonus to her Armor Class.

She may appraise the value of an item in 1 round.<br /><br /><strong>Sodden Stealth (Ex)</strong>: Shackles pirates spend their careers studying and adapting to their unique, marshy environs. As a result, they develop skills which allow them to stealthily approach their targets even over the wettest, muddiest ground. Most wear dark green and brown clothes made of oilcloth (to repel water) and reed hats with angled brims to keep rain out of their eyes. Shackles pirates sometimes string small beads in their hair to generate a quiet susurrus as they walk. This mimics the sound of wind in the bogs and helps mask the noise of their footsteps.<br /><br />A Shackles pirate gains a +2 competence bonus on Move Silently checks made in marshes, bogs, or swamps. At 5th level this bonus increases to +4, and at 10th level the bonus increases to +6.<br /><br /><strong>Bogstep (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Shackles pirate learns how to move quickly through the treacherous terrain of her home. She moves through shallow bogs normally, and it costs her 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep bog. She can Tumble through shallow bogs with no penalty and can Tumble through deep bogs with a &ndash;4 penalty.<br /><br /><strong>Deep Breath (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Shackles pirate can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to three times her Constitution score before she must start making Constitution checks.<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This is identical to the rogue sneak attack ability, and stacks with sneak attack gained from other sources.<br /><br /><strong>Navigate Maelstrom (Su)</strong>: The Eye of Abendego, the hurricane that constantly rages offshore, poses a hazard to all ships moving along the Shackles coast. Shackles pirates know how to successfully navigate the gusting winds and churning water. The hurricane exerts some unfathomable mystical influence over some of the pirates of the area.<br /><br />At 4th level, a Shackles pirate treats all storms as if they were one category less severe for purposes of sailing and navigation. She treats the Eye of Abendego as if it were a zone of inclement weather, rather than a powerful storm, for purposes of sailing and navigation.<br /><br /><strong>Grapple Ship (Su)</strong>: As a Shackles pirate&rsquo;s connection to the Eye of Abendego grows stronger, she learns to perform impossible feats. At 7th level, a Shackles pirate gains the ability to stop another ship dead in the water for a short time. To use this ability, the Shackles pirate must hurl a grappling hook at the target ship. The pirate is proficient with the grappling hook, and she throws it with a 20-foot range increment.<br /><br />If the Shackles pirate hits the target ship, she then makes an opposed Strength check. She gains a +1 bonus on her check for every crewmate who also grapples the enemy ship, although crewmates are considered non-proficient with grappling hooks and throw them with 10-foot range increments. For every point by which the Shackles pirate exceeds the ship&rsquo;s Strength check, she halts its progress for 1 round.<br /><br /><strong>Shipmind (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a Shackles pirate can, once per day as a standard action, control her ship with a thought. The Shackles pirate must be on the deck of the ship she wishes to control and she must be conscious.<br /><br />Once the Shackles pirate activates her shipmind, she can feel the ship as if it were an extension of her body. She can &ldquo;see&rdquo; from the ship anywhere she wants, and adjusting her point of view is a free action. The Shackles pirate can move the ship as if it were her own body, and it moves over water at her base move or the ship&rsquo;s normal speed, whichever is greater. She and her ship can move forward and backward, make right angle turns, and come to a dead stop, despite the ship&rsquo;s size or the weather conditions.<br /><br />While the Shackles pirate uses her shipmind ability, her body appears paralyzed and unresponsive. She is considered helpless and cannot defend herself, but she retains an awareness of what goes on around her body (and can see her body from her perspective on the ship if she wishes). She may end the shipmind effect as an immediate action. This ability lasts for 1 round per class level.<br /><br /><strong>Fogcraft (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, the Shackles pirate gains the incredible power to shape a vessel out of the fog that roils across the boggy landscape. This ability functions only in the Shackles and is usable once per day.<br /><br />Forming a craft takes 10 minutes, and the craft&rsquo;s duration lasts for a variable number of hours depending on its size. A fogcraft appears made of swirling gray mist but feels solid to the touch. Its unique composition can make it difficult to spot, and the craft makes no sound, but it does not baff le sounds made by its crew.<br /><br />A fogcraft has a carrying capacity equal to an ordinary ship of its type, but its impermanence makes it a poor cargo ship. It requires the appropriate number of crewmen in order to sail. A fogcraft possesses speed and maneuverability equal to that of an ordinary ship of its type, but unlike ordinary ships, a fogcraft can move over land as easily as water.<br /><br />A Shackles pirate receives a +4 competence bonus on skill checks made to sail her fogcraft.<br /><br />When a Shackles pirate creates a fogcraft, she can chose its size from any of the options listed below. With larger ships comes a trade-off in stealth, Armor Class, and duration.</p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fogcraft Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>AC</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Strength</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Carries<sup>1</sup></strong></td>\n<td><strong>Duration</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Hide</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Raft</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>10 hours</td>\n<td>+12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rowboat</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>10 hours</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Longship</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>170</td>\n<td>4 hours</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Keelboat</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>115</td>\n<td>4 hours</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sailing Ship</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>220</td>\n<td>4 hours</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warship</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>240</td>\n<td>2 hours</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Galley</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>34</td>\n<td>450</td>\n<td>2 hours</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tfoot>\n<tr>\n<td><sup>1</sup> Including the Shackles pirate herself.</td>\n</tr>\n</tfoot>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fOyqwhx4vvA2PEG4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bogstep (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.z5JwK2904to6fVVW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deep Breath (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sA1CQYtItcIYUCuJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Fogcraft (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":10,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MvEkKLOdviN7uNJI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Grapple Ship (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":7,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sIFJX4REIPquGkyG","dataType":"compendium","name":"Navigate Maelstrom (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.flWbxUyUEYlRBlug","dataType":"compendium","name":"Quick Appraise (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.b6NqgRLpA7QmMEE7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Shipmind (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":8,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LtW3TdS6igAjYwAR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":3,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.HNxy6gYbDzaJEAUW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sodden Stealth (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/flags/banner-flag-pirate.webp","level":1,"_index":8}]},"tag":"shacklesPirate","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":8,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Shamelessly willing to take advantage of their foes, they can instantly assess a situation in order to find a way to turn it to their own benefit. When a giant swings his club, the halfling opportunist leaps onto it and uses the momentum to make her jump go that much further. When a spellcaster hurls a bolt of magical energy, the halfling opportunist steps in front of a door and uses the power to help her to smash through so she can make her escape. When a courtier tries to blacken her name, the halfling opportunist lets loose such a stream of cheeky accusations that the courtier ends up looking like the traitor instead. Halfling opportunists&rsquo; ability to exploit their enemies gives them a breezy selfconfidence and the sheer audacity to take risks few others would dare. Perhaps because of this brazenness, they seem blessed by amazing strokes of good fortune. However, they rarely take their luck for granted. Instead they rely upon their keen senses to sidestep danger and their adaptability to carry them through both combat and social settings.<br /><br />Most halfling opportunists begin their careers as rogues, with bards and rangers tied as distant seconds. Barbarians and fighters with the presence of mind to adjust their combat styles prove surprisingly effective. Paladins and monks, troubled by the halfling opportunist ethos of deception and exploitation, are rarer entry points of this class than spellcasters.<br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Their amazing luck, acute sense of danger, and ability to assess and then seize the advantage in virtually any situation makes halfling opportunists ideally suited for scouting or taking the front of party lines, especially when fighting only one enemy.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Halfling opportunists view deception and taking advantage of others as a way of life. This makes it very difficult (but not impossible) for lawful characters that choose this prestige class to stick to their principles.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a halfling opportunist, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Race</strong>: Halfling.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Perception 5 ranks, Stealth 5 ranks.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Defensive Combat Training.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Halfling Opportunist's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), and Swim (Cha).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 6 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.521%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.9348%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.521%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.9348%;\">Exploitive maneuver, trap spotter, excelled aid (+1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.521%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.9348%;\">Exceptionally lucky (+2), sneak attack +1d6, improved trap spotter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.521%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.9348%;\">Fit in, excellent aid (+2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.521%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.9348%;\">Exceptionally lucky (+3), sneak attack +2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.26672%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.521%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 54.9348%;\">Opportunity attacker, excellent aid (+3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />All of the following are class features of the halfling opportunist prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Halfling opportunists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.<br /><br /><strong>Exploitive Maneuver (Ex)</strong>: A halfling opportunist can use an enemy&rsquo;s actions in combat for her own gain, as if the opponent were using aid another to assist the opportunist, giving her a bonus on her next skill check, attack roll, or to AC against the next attack (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> 86 and 197). The enemy must be able to reach the opportunist, and the opportunist must activate this ability as an immediate action and succeed at a combat maneuver check against the enemy&rsquo;s CMD; at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, the opportunist can substitute another ability score modifier for her Strength modifier when making her combat maneuver check (such as using Dexterity for an agility-related action or Charisma for a social-related action). If the halfling succeeds at this combat maneuver check, she adds the aid another bonus to her action on her next turn and subtracts that bonus from the enemy&rsquo;s roll for that action. Note that if the combat maneuver check is successful, the outcome of the enemy&rsquo;s roll is irrelevant to this ability&mdash;a halfling opportunist can use a giant&rsquo;s swinging club to jump farther whether the giant hits or misses with its attack roll.<br /><br />The GM decides whether the enemy&rsquo;s action can benefit the opportunist in the desired manner. Circumstances occurring between the enemy&rsquo;s turn and the halfling&rsquo;s turn may prevent her from following through with the desired action); if this occurs, she loses the bonus from aid another but can take her turn normally.<br /><br /><em>Example</em>: Piria is a halfling opportunist battling an ogre in a walled arena. On the ogre&rsquo;s turn, it swings at her with its club; Piria&rsquo;s player wants to use her exploitive ability to catch the club and use its movement to boost her toward the top of the arena wall, giving her a bonus on her Acrobatics check to jump. The GM decides this is a reasonable use, has the player make a combat maneuver check against the giant&rsquo;s CMD, and allows her to use Piria&rsquo;s Dexterity bonus in place of her Strength bonus in the check. She succeeds and will gain the aid another bonus on her Climb check on her next turn. The GM rolls the ogre&rsquo;s attack with a &ndash;2 penalty, hits Piria, and deals damage, but Piria still gets the aid another bonus on her next Acrobatics check&mdash; perhaps as the ogre&rsquo;s club hit her, she grabbed it, flipped onto it, and on her turn can jump from the swinging club using the +2 bonus from aid another.<br /><br /><strong>Trap Spotter (Ex)</strong>: A halfling opportunist has a keen ability to notice and react to danger. She gains the trap spotter rogue talent.<br /><br /><strong>Excellent Aid (Ex)</strong>: A halfling opportunist has an amazing talent for getting the most out of those who assist her. Increase the bonus she gets from aid another by +1. This increases by another +1 at 3rd level and again at 5th level. This increase does not apply to when she uses aid another to help others, only when others aid her.<br /><br /><strong>Exceptionally Lucky (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a halfling opportunist learns how to squeeze even more from her innate luck. Her halfling racial bonus on saving throws increases to +2. This bonus increases to +3 at 4th level.<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 for every even level (2nd and 4th). If a halfling opportunist gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on the damage stack.<br /><br /><strong>Improved Trap Spotter (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, the range of the opportunist&rsquo;s trap spotter ability increases to 20 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Fit In (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a halfling opportunist masters the art of sending out nonverbal cues that suggest agreement and affiliation. This enables her to act as if she belongs in any situation, whether an aristocratic garden party or an evil cult&rsquo;s inner sanctum. She can make a Disguise check in lieu of a Diplomacy check to influence the initial attitudes of NPCs. She does not need to change her appearance to make this check&mdash;this ability relies on instinctively knowing how to act to make it appear she belongs. If multiple creatures with differing views of appropriate behavior are present, she cannot simultaneously affect them and must choose a target creature or group to influence&mdash;she can&rsquo;t pretend to be a guest at a fancy party to impress the nobles and pretend to be a maid to mingle with the servants at the same time.<br /><br /><strong>Opportunity Attacker (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a halfling opportunist masters the art of striking foes when they are at their most vulnerable. When making an attack of opportunity, she deals her sneak attack damage even if her target is not flat-footed or otherwise denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YIC5wq6vNGMcez5p","dataType":"compendium","name":"Excellent Aid (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/halfling.png","level":3,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fth3wHPJRTiAQkuQ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Exceptionally Lucky (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/halfling.png","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Ozz41Xbq0eIH1Na6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Exploitive Maneuver (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/halfling.png","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FsdiWCx2f5zAeI07","dataType":"compendium","name":"Fit In (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/halfling.png","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hEV8JsnrR53XRY0m","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Trap Spotter (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/halfling.png","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.A9PNCXFvh5CobB3j","dataType":"compendium","name":"Opportunity Attacker (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/halfling.png","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.xKANdsEh4VqO1vXY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Trap Spotter (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/races/halfling.png","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hg4XFMbTOcEnnChg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/clover.webp","level":2,"_index":7}]},"tag":"halflingOpportunist","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Their cultivars and gardeners were renowned, but such peaceful pursuits waned in prominence when the expansionist pharaohs of Osirion remade the land into a staging ground for war against the Jistka Imperium to the west. The old ways nearly became extinct, yet the lore of the desert&rsquo;s delicate blooms never entirely disappeared.<br /><br />Though the great libraries and conservatories were gone, simple tribal botanists passed what they could from generation to generation. Even the most warlike clan chiefs realized careful cultivation was the key to survival in this harsh and unforgiving land. Then, when Artokus Kirran discovered the <em>sun orchid elixir </em>in 1140 ar, the long-neglected art of herbalism and the reinvigorated science of alchemy intertwined to create something entirely new&mdash;a practice that has since f lourished in modern Thuvia and given rise to the renowned Thuvian alchemists.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Thuvian

Proficiency</strong>: A Thuvian alchemist gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Extracts or Spells per Day</strong>: When a Thuvian alchemist gains a level, she gains new extracts or spells per day as if she had also gained a level in alchemist or in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional extracts or spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous caster), and an increased effective caster level for extracts or spells. If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a Thuvian alchemist, or had the alchemist class and an arcane spellcasting class, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purpose of determining extracts or spells per day.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oAez4u83zzUaZxjv]{Healing Solution (Su)}<br /><br /><strong>Healing Solution (Su)</strong>: A Thuvian alchemist learns how to convert magical reagents into life-giving admixtures. As a full-round action, she can convert the magical energies of two extracts or spells of 1st level into a special extract of <em>cure light wounds</em>. This acts as an infused extract, but it must be used before the end of her next turn or its power is lost. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Thuvian alchemist gains the ability to convert extracts or spells into more powerful forms of curative magic: 3rd&mdash;<em>cure moderate wounds</em>; 5th&mdash;<em>cure serious wounds</em>; 7th&mdash;<em>cure critical wounds</em>; 9th&mdash;<em>breath of life</em>. In all cases, the Thuvian alchemist must expend two extracts or spells of the same level as the curative spell in order to complete the conversion.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wpSuXuV34e3YQPCz]{Thuvian Discovery}<br /><br /><strong>Thuvian Discovery</strong>: At 2nd level and again at 4th, 6th, and 8th level, a Thuvian alchemist gains a new alchemist discovery (<em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide </em>28) from one of the rare Thuvian discoveries below or from the following list: bottled ooze<sup>UM</sup>, combine extracts, dilution, elixir of life, enhance potion, eternal potion, extend potion, healing touch<sup>UM</sup>, infusion, mummification<sup>UM</sup>, preserve organs<sup>UM</sup>, sandstone solution (see page 23), or spontaneous healing<sup>UM</sup>. The Thuvian alchemist must still meet all prerequisites for a Thuvian discovery, including level restrictions. Thuvian alchemist class levels stack with alchemist levels for the purpose of qualifying for and using these discoveries (but not others). Thuvian discoveries cannot be selected by characters without Thuvian alchemist levels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cwlPoEKytIeqoRyt]{Bottled Elemental (Su)}<br /><br /><strong>Bottled Elemental (Su)</strong>: This functions like the bottled ooze<sup>UM</sup> discovery, but allows the Thuvian alchemist to instead reconstitute an elemental that bursts forth when the bottle is broken. Creating a bottled elemental requires an extract 1 level lower than the elemental&rsquo;s CR (minimum 1st level). The Thuvian alchemist must have the bottled ooze discovery and be at least 8th level before selecting this Thuvian discovery.<br /><br /><em>Capture Elemental (Sp)</em>: A Thuvian alchemist can capture an elemental inside a specially prepared bottle, vial, or f lask, as if using <em>trap the soul </em>as a spell-like ability, though this ability affects only elementals. Preparing the bottle costs 500 gp per Hit Die of the elemental to be trapped and takes 1 day per 1,000 gp of value. If the Thuvian alchemist tries to capture an elemental with too many Hit Dice, the bottle shatters. The Thuvian alchemist must have the bottled elemental discovery and be at least 12th level before selecting this Thuvian discovery.<br /><br /><em>Extra Curative Enhancement (Ex)</em>: The Thuvian alchemist can select one additional curative enhancement that she can incorporate into her healing solution.<br /><br /><em>Shared Infusion (Su)</em>: When a Thuvian alchemist creates an infusion extract of a spell that normally affects multiple targets, the extract can affect a number of targets equal to her Intelligence bonus (up to the maximum normally allowed for the spell), though each creature must use a standard action to imbibe the extract. Only creatures that drink from the extract within 1 round of when the first imbiber starts drinking it are affected. A Thuvian alchemist must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.HLqfQQl8XVsNskJy]{Bombs}<br /><br /><strong>Bombs</strong>: At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a Thuvian alchemist adds 1d6 points of damage to her bomb damage, gains one additional bomb per day, and treats her alchemist level as 1 higher for the purpose of qualifying for discoveries that affect her bombs. A character without alchemist levels gains the bombs ability of an alchemist whose level is equal to 1/3 her Thuvian alchemist level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.77wZAMDzqroxfZBd]{Curative Enhancement (Su)}<br /><br /><strong>Curative Enhancement (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Thuvian alchemist can select one curative enhancement. Whenever the Thuvian alchemist creates a healing solution by expending two extracts or spells, she may reduce the amount of hit point damage cured by one step (reducing a healing solution of <em>cure moderate wounds</em> to one of <em>cure light wounds</em>, for instance) in order to apply any number of her curative enhancements to her healing solution. These enhancements can remove conditions caused by curses, diseases, or poisons even if they do not remove the underlying aff liction itself; the conditions return after 1 hour unless the curative enhancement actually removes the aff liction that causes the condition.<br /><br />At 3rd level, a Thuvian alchemist can select one of the following conditions that her healing solution can remove: fatigued, shaken, or sickened.<br /><br />At 5th level, she can also select dazed, diseased (as <em>remove disease</em>), or staggered.<br /><br />At 7th level, she can also select cursed (as <em>remove curse</em>), exhausted (must already have selected fatigued), frightened (must already have selected shaken), nauseated (must already have selected sickened), or poisoned (as <em>neutralize poison</em>).<br /><br />At 9th level, she can also select blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or stunned.<br /><br />Once chosen, a curative enhancement cannot be changed, but the Thuvian alchemist can choose which enhancements (if any) she incorporates each time she prepares a healing solution.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6O4PTs12AHPiANmo]{Eternal Youth (Su)}<br /><br /><strong>Eternal Youth (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Thuvian alchemist learns how to formulate an imperfect duplicate of the <em>sun orchid elixir </em>that affects only her.

She does not gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a demoniac, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Damned (Ex)</strong>: When a demoniac is killed, her soul is instantly claimed by the Abyss, to be transformed over time into a demon appropriate to the greatest sins the demoniac gloried in while she lived. A character attempting to resurrect a slain demoniac must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the demoniac&rsquo;s character level or the spell fails. That character cannot attempt to resurrect the demoniac again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do so.<br /><br /><strong>Demonic Mark (Ex)</strong>: A demoniac bears the sign of her demon lord as a tattoo-like brand somewhere on her body. Once per day, a demoniac can call upon the profane magic of this mark to power a spell as she casts it. Doing so causes the spell to gain the chaotic and evil descriptors, and it causes the spell not be expended as it is cast, allowing the demoniac to cast the spell again at a later point in the day.<br /><br /><strong>Obedience (Ex)</strong>: In order to maintain her demoniac abilities (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by the class), a demoniac must indulge her chosen demon lord with a daily obedience. This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the demoniac uses to regain spellcasting abilities (such as meditating, praying to a demon lord, or studying a spellbook). When a character takes her first level of demoniac, she must decide whether she is an evangelist, an exalted, or a sentinel of her demonic patron. This choice determines which category of boons she earns as she gains levels, and once made, it cannot later be changed.<br /><br /><strong>Energumen (Su)</strong>: Once per day at 2nd level, a demoniac can open her soul to a demonic spirit as a free action. This demonic spirit possesses the demoniac for a number of rounds equal to her demoniac level, granting a +2 profane bonus to one ability score of the demoniac&rsquo;s choice.<br /><br />At 5th level, energumen grants a +4 profane bonus to one ability score, electricity resistance 10, and a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison.<br /><br />At 7th level, energumen grants a +6 profane bonus to one ability score and immunity to electricity and poison.<br /><br />When the energumen ends, the demoniac becomes confused for a number of rounds equal to her demoniac level as the demonic spirit has its way with her mind. At the start of each round of confusion, the demoniac can attempt a DC 25 Will save to end the confusion effect immediately.<br /><br />Energumen is a possession effect, and it is negated by protection from evil or protection from chaos. A demoniac can prevent or end the confusion side effect by using one of these spells, but being affected by such a spell before the energumen has run its course also causes the benefits granted to end prematurely.<br /><br /><strong>Demonic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su)</strong>: As a demoniac gains levels, she gains boons from her demonic patron as her body and soul become increasingly infused with demonic energies. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the demoniac&rsquo;s chosen demon lord and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each demon lord grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the demoniac gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the demon lord and nascent demon lord descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a demonic boon grants a spell-like ability, the demoniac&rsquo;s caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a demoniac to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.<br /><br /><strong>Summon Demon (Sp)</strong>: Once per day at 4th level, a demoniac can cast <em>summon monster VI</em> to conjure one succubus, 1d3 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraksB6 to serve her. At 8th level, the demoniac also gains the ability to cast <em>summon monster VIII</em> once per day to conjure one hezrou, 1d3 vrocks, or 1d4+1 succubi to serve her.<br /><br /><strong>Demonic Form (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a demoniac can undergo a temporary transformation into a unique demon as a standard action. Her type changes to outsider with the chaotic, demon, evil, and native subtypes. She gains damage reduction 10/good and cold iron, resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, and telepathy to a range of 100 feet. When she first gains this ability, she chooses to gain one additional physical transformation from the following when she transforms: wings (fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or a single natural attack (bite, claw, gore, slam, or tail sting; damage dealt as appropriate for the demoniac&rsquo;s size). Once this additional physical transformation is chosen, it can never be changed. The newly created demon&rsquo;s natural weapons and any weapon it wields are treated as chaotic and evil for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The demoniac can remain in this form for a number of minutes per day equal to her character level; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Returning to her normal form is a free action.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QxfJEAFh070yaEWO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Damned (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_25.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.U8NpKUn0B4Tc7kUl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Demonic Mark (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_25.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cvOXT4jHMYTKAWD9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Obedience (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_25.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MUBqCaR3D1IXfnwx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Energumen (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_25.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hKkx0rbTEBdaYxpX","dataType":"compendium","name":"Demonic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_25.jpg","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6Arz09I63GMd0NWs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Summon Demon (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_25.jpg","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kXysARGzQKiAYmhR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Demonic Form (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_25.jpg","level":10,"_index":6}]},"tag":"demoniac","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":"demonic patron’s favored weapon"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

She does not gain any other benefits a character of that class would have gained except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a proctor, she must decide which class she adds each new proctor level for the purpose of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Monitor Familiar</strong> (Ex): The proctor gains the services of an <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Arbiter\">arbiter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Nosoi\">nosoi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paracletus\">paracletus</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Voidworm\">voidworm</a> familiar, as appropriate for the proctor's monitor demigod. This functions as the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wizard\">wizard's arcane bond class feature</a>, but as if the proctor had selected the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Familiar\">Improved Familiar</a> feat. If the proctor has levels in another class that grants a familiar, levels in that class and the proctor class stack for determining the overall abilities of her familiar. <br /><br /><strong>Obedience (Ex)</strong>: In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class (including all spellcasting abilities augmented by this prestige class), a proctor must perform a daily obedience to her monitor, as set forth in the description of each monitor demigod. <br /><br /><strong>Soultended (Ex)</strong>: Upon death, a proctor's soul appears on one of the neutral Outer Planes that corresponds to her monitor demigod and begins the gradual transformation into an <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ItemName=Aeon\">aeon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ItemName=Inevitable\">inevitable</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ItemName=Protean\">protean</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ItemName=Psychopomp\">psychopomp</a>. A character attempting to resurrect a slain proctor must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the proctor's character level or the spell fails. That character cannot attempt to resurrect the proctor again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do so. The comforting inevitability of this fate grants the proctor a +2 bonus on Will saves. <br /><br /><strong>Monitor Expression (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a proctor must select a specific expression of her role for her monitor demigod. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Although a proctor's expression often aligns with her demigod, this isn't a strict requirement. Each expression provides a different benefit to the proctor.<br /><br />Executors discharge their assigned duties in an efficient and orderly manner, and most often align with the primal inevitables. A proctor with this expression gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease, paralysis, poison, sleep, and stunning. At 5th level, this bonus also applies on saves against mind-affecting effects.<br /><br />Fosters work to strengthen existing social relationships, and most often align with the psychopomp ushers. As a swift action, a proctor with this expression can gain the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterSubtypes.aspx?ItemName=Psychopomp\">spiritsense ability</a>, and she can end the effect as a free action. The foster can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her proctor level. These rounds need not be consecutive. At 5th level, the duration increases to 1 minute, and the foster can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her proctor level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments.<br /><br />Harmonizers bring balance to opposing factions, and most often align with the Monad. As a swift action, a proctor with this expression can become semitangible and gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC. The harmonizer can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her proctor level, and she can end the effect as a free action. These rounds need not be consecutive. At 5th level, this deflection bonus increases to +4.<br /><br />Impulsives let their instincts guide them, and most often align with the protean lords. A proctor with this expression can cast <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement\"><em>freedom of movement</em></a> once per day as a spell-like ability. At 5th level, the proctor can use this ability as a swift action. <br /><br /><strong>Monitor Boon</strong>: As a proctor gains levels, she gains boons from her monitor demigod. The nature of the boons varies depending on the proctor's chosen demigod. A monitor demigod grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the proctor gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Monitor%20Obedience\">Monitor Obedience</a> feat and the monitor demigod descriptions for details on monitor boons.<br /><br />When a monitor demigod grants a spell-like ability, the proctor's level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a proctor to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally. <br /><br /><strong>Summon Monitor (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, a proctor can cast <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=summon%20monster%206\"><em>summon monster VI</em></a> once per day to conjure monitors based on her monitor expression. An executor can summon one <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=axiomite\">Axiomite</a>, 1d3 <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mercane\">mercanes</a>, or 1d4+1 <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Novenarut\">novenaruts</a>.

Yet the student of war knows that the key to victory is the mind behind the mettle, the training that guides the blade, and the discernment of when and where to strike. Any dedicated martial scholar can join this prestige class, but the Pathfinder Society draws the lion&rsquo;s share. The Society&rsquo;s libraries are a treasure trove to the aspiring student of war, home to obscure combat manuals, moldy bestiaries, and detailed histories of battle. Armed with these texts and hardened by constant drilling, the student of war fills her repertoire with tricks and techniques designed to exploit every weakness and negate every advantage of her foes.<br /><br />The path of the student of war is particularly enticing to martially minded characters who seek to enhance and expand their mastery of skills. Students of war often pride themselves in studying topics that combat-focused types might not normally find value in, and their ability to draw upon unexpected lore and information has become something of a legend among their kind. This might be demonstrated by a heavily armored fighter&rsquo;s training in Acrobatics allowing her to outmaneuver an overly confident swashbuckler, a rugged barbarian masterfully manipulating a magic wand via Use Magic Device, or similar unexpected techniques.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a student of war, a character must fulfill the following

/><strong> Additional Skill</strong>: At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, a student of war gains a new class skill of her choice.<br /><br /><strong> Know Your Enemy (Ex)</strong>: As a move action, a student of war can study a foe she can see and attempt a Knowledge check appropriate to the creature&rsquo;s type (DC = 10 + the target&rsquo;s HD). Success grants her a +1 insight bonus against her enemy, which can be applied via one of the following stances (chosen when the check is attempted) to the indicated statistics and rolls.<br /><br /><em> Defensive Stance</em>: The bonus applies to Armor Class and on saving throws against the target&rsquo;s attacks. At 6th level, the student of war is treated as having the Mobility feat when provoking attacks of opportunity from the studied foe. If she already has Mobility, the bonus she gains to her AC in this case increases to +6.<br /><br /><em> Martial Stance</em>: The bonus applies on attack and damage rolls against the target. At 4th level, the student of war is treated as having the Critical Focus feat for the purpose of attacks against the studied foe. If she already has Critical Focus, the bonus she gains when confirming her critical hits in this case is +6 instead.<br /><br /><em> Tactical Stance</em>: The bonus applies on combat maneuver checks and to CMD when initiating or defending against bull rush, disarm, grapple, overrun, and trip combat maneuvers. At 8th level, the student of war no longer provokes attacks of opportunity from a studied foe when attempting to bull rush, disarm, grapple, overrun, or trip that target; this does not affect attacks of opportunity made by any creature other than the studied foe.<br /><br />A student of war can change her stance as a move action. The bonus lasts for 1 minute per class level or until the character uses this ability on another target. The bonus increases to +2 at 4th level and +3 at 7th level. At 7th level, the student can use this ability as a swift action rather than a move action.<br /><br /><strong> Combat Feat</strong>: At 2nd, 5th, and 8th levels, a student of war gains a bonus combat feat.<br /><br /><strong> Mind Over Metal (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, when a student of war is using armor or a shield, she can use her Intelligence modifier in place of her Dexterity modifier for determining her Armor Class. The armor&rsquo;s normal maximum Dexterity bonus still applies (limiting how much of the character&rsquo;s Intelligence bonus she can apply to her AC).<br /><br /><strong> Anticipate (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, once per day as an immediate action, a student of war can ignore any damage and effects of a spell or ability she successfully saved against, such as the outlining effect of a <em>glitterdust</em> spell or the half damage from an <em>inflict serious wounds</em> spell. This ability has no effect against effects that do not allow saving throws (such as <em>darkness</em>, difficult terrain, etc.). This ability is usable one additional time per day for every 3 class levels beyond 3rd.<br /><br /><strong> Telling Blow (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a student of war can aim her blows at the weakest point in a studied foe&rsquo;s defense, ignoring up to 5 points of damage reduction. This does not apply to damage reduction without a type (such as DR 10/&mdash;). This ability cannot be used against creatures that are immune to critical hits or otherwise lack discernible weak points. This ability stacks with the Penetrating Strike feat.<br /><br /><strong> Nemesis (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, once per day as a swift action, a student of war can focus on a weapon she holds and render it anathema to her studied foe. The weapon gains the bane special ability against the creature for 1 minute or until the student of war uses know your enemy against a different foe.<br /><br /><strong> Deadly Blow (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a student of war can find weak spots where none should exist. A student of war who uses her know your enemy ability and exceeds the Knowledge check DC by 10 or more can ignore the target&rsquo;s natural damage reduction and immunity to critical hits and sneak attacks. This does not apply to immunities granted by spells, environmental effects, or equipment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.GVq3P0cSk7m8PVzE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Additional Skill","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.amXSU5iEz0GTRPYW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Anticipate (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ZgR9VbwlkekF1qCR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Combat Feat","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.w56sdEVxgXA1mLzj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deadly Blow (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":10,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eiLHn0IZnfsM0DJc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Know Your Enemy (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.OiFHTMLTEu9jdEru","dataType":"compendium","name":"Martial Stance","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.myMrIU9QyZYz9P7u","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mind Over Metal (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":2,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2RSWjRqweDYPGXWD","dataType":"compendium","name":"Nemesis (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":9,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vBvrssRaFsLaONyy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tactical Stance","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":1,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aT6POJLz15UMCLvU","dataType":"compendium","name":"Telling Blow (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":6,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.e46u6sTgyqUTenni","dataType":"compendium","name":"Defensive Stance","img":"icons/weapons/polearms/halberd-crescent-glowing.webp","level":1,"_index":10}]},"tag":"studentOfWar","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":true,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A mystery cultist gains proficiency with all simple weapons and with her celestial patron&rsquo;s favored weapon. She gains no additional proficiency with armor or shields.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known</strong>: At the indicated levels, when a new mystery cultist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before taking the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a mystery cultist, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Blessed (Ex)</strong>: Upon a mystery cultist&rsquo;s death, her soul appears in the good Outer Planes. In time, her soul will transform into an agathion, angel, archon, or azata.<br /><br />If the mystery cultist is successfully resurrected, she may immediately gain the answer to any one question as if she had cast <em>contact other plane</em> and reached her empyreal lord patron. The mystery cultist need not succeed at an Intelligence check to avoid a decrease in Intelligence or Charisma. The empyreal lord is treated as an &ldquo;intermediate deity of the Outer Planes&rdquo;&mdash;treat any &ldquo;lie&rdquo; result as &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; instead.<br /><br /><strong>Obedience (Ex)</strong>: In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by this prestige class), a mystery cultist must indulge in a daily obedience to her chosen empyreal lord (see page 5).<br /><br /><strong>Glorious Aura (Su)</strong>: Starting at 2nd level, a mystery cultist can shroud herself in a glorious aura for 1 round per mystery cultist level. These rounds need not be consecutive. Her features radiate with divine beauty, but the force of her presence can be frightening to others. The mystery cultist gains a +4 sacred bonus to her Charisma score and radiates a 10-foot aura of terrible awe. Creatures within the aura must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + the mystery cultist&rsquo;s class level + the mystery cultist&rsquo;s Charisma modifier) or become frightened for 1d4 rounds. Regardless of whether the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by a mystery cultist&rsquo;s glorious aura more than once in 24 hours. This is a fear effect.<br /><br /><strong>Celestial Boon</strong>: As the mystery cultist gains levels, she gains boons from her celestial patron. The nature of the boons varies depending on the mystery cultist&rsquo;s chosen empyreal lord. Each empyreal lord grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the mystery cultist gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the Celestial Obedience feat on page 5 and the empyreal lord descriptions in Chapter One for details on celestial boons. When a celestial boon grants a spell-like ability, the mystery cultist&rsquo;s level for the spelllike ability equals her total character level. This ability allows a mystery cultist to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.<br /><br /><strong>Brand of Healing (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, the mystery cultist gains the ability to cast <em>heal </em>as a spell-like ability once per day. The target of this ability is branded on the forehead or another visible area with an incandescent tattoo of the holy symbol of the mystery cultist&rsquo;s patron. The holy brand lasts for 24 hours before fading.<br /><br /><strong>Summon Celestial (Sp)</strong>: Starting at 4th level, a mystery cultist can use <em>summon monster VI</em> once per day to conjure one lillend, 1d3 bralanis, or 1d4+1 hound archons to serve her. At 8th level, the mystery cultist also gains the ability to use <em>summon monster VIII</em> once per day to conjure one monadic deva, 1d3 avoral agathions, or 1d4+1 lillends to serve her. Mystery cultists who worship a particular empyreal lord may be able to summon other good outsiders of equal power with this ability (according to GM discretion).<br /><br /><strong>Fervor (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, the mystery cultist can enter a religious fervor for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level, and can enter a fervor or end it as a free action. While in this fervor, the mystery cultist gains a +2 sacred bonus on all weapon attack and damage rolls, DR 5/evil, and a +2 bonus to her caster level for the purposes of determining the range, duration, and level-dependent effects of spells. In addition, her base speed increases by 10 feet.<br /><br />A mystery cultist takes a &ndash;4 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks during the fervor and for a number of minutes afterward equal to 2 &times; the number of rounds spent in the religious fervor.<br /><br /><strong>Incorruptible (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, the mystery cultist gains a +2 bonus on saving throws versus disease and poison. If the mystery cultist is killed, her body does not decompose, but stays pure and whole as if targeted by a permanent <em>gentle repose</em> spell. This effectively extends the period in which she can be affected by a <em>raise dead</em> spell indefinitely. Finally, this ability prevents the mystery cultist from ever being transformed into an undead creature by any means short of a <em>wish </em>or <em>miracle</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Sacred Haven (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, the mystery cultist earns a place at the side of her celestial patron. A room is set aside for her at her patron&rsquo;s place of residence on the celestial planes (if her patron has no permanent residence, the room stands alone in a quiet spot on the celestial planes). Once per day, the mystery cultist can teleport herself and one willing creature per mystery cultist level to this sacred haven as per <em>plane shift</em>, except she always arrives exactly at the threshold of her haven. The room is outfitted with comfortable beds for everyone, a small research library, a shrine, and a chest or cupboard that functions as a <em>portable hole</em> but that cannot be removed from the room. The mystery cultist can teleport herself and her allies out of the sacred haven at will, but can only return to the spot from which they last left.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ex-Mystery Cultists</h2>\n<p>A mystery cultist whose alignment becomes any nongood, or who goes against the will of her patron, loses all class features of this prestige class, including all spellcasting ability enhanced by this class (even if that spellcasting ability comes from a class that normally does not rely on the approval of a divine patron). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a mystery cultist until she atones for her deeds (see the <em>atonement </em>spell description). This is the only route a mystery cultist can take to switch to a different celestial patron&mdash;the <em>atonement </em>must come from a worshiper of the new empyreal lord.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gaJBjVf9y6WNz70e","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blessed (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.jyTx8ESJK21QuEZc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Brand of Healing (Sp)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":4,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.70PnqGLdGklKvY8X","dataType":"compendium","name":"Celestial Boon","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":3,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KmtDDLu690DySH1e","dataType":"compendium","name":"Fervor (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":5,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qqRv6BA2sfcZA0pT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Glorious Aura (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TRsIXl5lBlkfwSuE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Incorruptible (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":7,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Tx5eRUQGi6JAU1ag","dataType":"compendium","name":"Obedience (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Rk9tCK5QkzOoGXLl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sacred Haven (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":10,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.RXnvDqnbCfbg4uYM","dataType":"compendium","name":"Summon Celestial (Sp)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-red.webp","level":4,"_index":8}]},"tag":"mysteryCultist","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":"Celestial patron’s favored weapon"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"EE7ooB0OLqasi444","name":"Assassin","type":"class","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1 class=\"title\">Assassin</h1>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Source</strong> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 378</em></a><br />A mercenary undertaking his task with cold, professional detachment, the assassin is equally adept at espionage, bounty hunting, and terrorism. At his core, an assassin is an artisan, and his medium is death. Trained in a variety of killing techniques, assassins are among the most feared classes. <br /><br />While nearly any class is capable of becoming an assassin, rogues suit the part more than any other, from both an ability viewpoint and an ideological one. Though they make excellent allies during combat, assassins excel in more clandestine situations, and the best assassins are the ones the victims never knew existed. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Assassins tend to be loners by nature, seeing companions as liabilities at best. Sometimes an assassin's missions put him in the company of adventurers for long stretches at a time, but few people are comfortable trusting a professional assassin to watch their backs in a fight, and are more likely to let the emotionless killer scout ahead or help prepare ambushes. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Due to its necessary selfishness and callous indifference toward taking lives, the assassin class attracts those with evil alignments more than any others. Because the profession requires a degree of self-discipline, chaotic characters are ill suited to becoming these shadowy killers. Neutral characters sometimes become assassins, frequently thinking of themselves as simple professionals performing a job, yet the nature of their duties inevitably pushes them toward an evil alignment.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an assassin, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any evil. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Disguise 2 ranks, Stealth 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: The character must kill someone for no other reason than to become an assassin.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Assassin's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str), and Use Magic Device (Cha).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">Sneak attack +1d6, death attack, poison use</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">+1 save bonus against poison, uncanny dodge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">Sneak attack +2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">+2 save bonus against poison, hidden weapons, true death</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">Improved uncanny dodge, sneak attack +3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">+3 save bonus against poison, quiet death</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">Sneak attack +4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">+4 save bonus against poison, hide in plain sight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">Sneak attack +5d6, swift death</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.22826%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.6768%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.9553%;\">+5 save bonus against poison, angel of death</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />All of the following are class features of the assassin prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Assassins are proficient with the crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Assassins are proficient with light armor but not with shields. <br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack</strong>: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). If an assassin gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. <br /><br /><strong>Death Attack (Ex)</strong>: If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). Studying the victim is a standard action. The death attack fails if the target detects the assassin or recognizes the assassin as an enemy (although the attack might still be a sneak attack if the target is denied his Dexterity bonus to his Armor Class or is flanked). If the victim of such a death attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. <br /><br />If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack. <br /><br /><strong>Poison Use</strong>: Assassins are trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison themselves when applying poison to a blade (see Poison). <br /><br /><strong>Save Bonus against Poison</strong>: At 2nd level, the assassin gains a +1 saving throw bonus against poisons. This bonus increase by +1 every two levels. <br /><br /><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an assassin cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. An assassin with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him. <br /><br />If an assassin already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead. <br /><br /><strong>Hidden Weapons (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, an assassin becomes a master at hiding weapons on his body. He adds his assassin level to all Sleight of Hand skill checks made to prevent others from noticing them. <br /><br /><strong>True Death (Su)</strong>: Starting at 4th level, anyone slain by an assassin's death attack becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a creature back from the dead using <em>raise dead </em>or similar magic must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + the assassin's level or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. Casting <em>remove curse </em>the round before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead negates this chance. The DC of the <em>remove curse </em>is 10 + the assassin's level. <br /><br /><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level and higher, an assassin can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the assassin by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has assassin levels. <br /><br />If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character. <br /><br /><strong>Quiet Death (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, whenever an assassin kills a creature using his death attack during a surprise round, he can also make a Stealth check, opposed by Perception checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them from identifying him as the assailant. If successful, those nearby might not even notice that the target is dead for a few moments, allowing the assassin to avoid detection. <br /><br /><strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, an assassin can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, an assassin can hide himself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow. <br /><br /><strong>Swift Death (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, once per day, an assassin can make a death attack against a foe without studying the foe beforehand. He must still sneak attack his foe using a melee weapon that deals damage. <br /><br /><strong>Angel of Death (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, the assassin becomes a master of death. Once per day, when the assassin makes a successful death attack, he can cause the target's body to crumble to dust. This prevents <em>raise dead </em>and <em>resurrection </em>(although <em>true resurrection </em>works as normal). The assassin must declare the use of this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against the death attack, this ability is wasted with no effect.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"_index":0,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EK1OKnTdJ6b0Y9oz","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":10,"name":"Angel of Death (Su)"},{"_index":1,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MRdGWNt0t8t75kjo","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":4,"name":"Hidden Weapons (Ex)"},{"_index":2,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.RmvHgVAjap4eNbPt","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":5,"name":"Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)"},{"_index":3,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.uJJtqS3zr3Jqb6Af","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":1,"name":"Poison Use"},{"_index":4,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Yl3vWVAbxA55GiMJ","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":6,"name":"Quiet Death (Ex)"},{"_index":5,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kEvl4FAfeek1ibaV","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":2,"name":"Save Bonus against Poison"},{"_index":6,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6vz8uvlIV8D9lZDZ","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":1,"name":"Sneak Attack"},{"_index":7,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NeNivPTVfymk3Rxw","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":9,"name":"Swift Death (Ex)"},{"_index":8,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.CAs14O9JEYTjzlBe","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":4,"name":"True Death (Su)"},{"_index":9,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lLgDBIBUUBjReeYD","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":2,"name":"Uncanny Dodge (Ex)"},{"_index":10,"dataType":"compendium","id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.HEFFqIytXI7GydrD","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","level":8,"name":"Hide in Plain Sight (Su)"}]},"tag":"assassin","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":6,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Assassin","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3,"vSiUSL2yrv8ejOhx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-classes.EE7ooB0OLqasi444"},"pf1":{"links":{"classAssociations":{"BTht95ZFdo3FgrjU":4,"EAyTXTPAy5eYoX3e":4,"FZCu2dMlf3FYkKPU":2,"acn02IsRy8VGHLAf":1,"ck2LOVNLzb5OOeYx":1,"foMBrjs7e4N1dwuG":2,"iQKwfWjZbxN9pNo7":2,"ki9tNGtEq2fo7Edd":5,"mOMLbvhLLKvf4XYu":4,"mUkzCen7zTzy3vAz":1,"oAFBbUlr7Cd6FE8m":1,"qgRQFXOP9U7t677n":2,"qvGXGrPLsKvBJ78T":5,"smh7eV840UmeX1Nk":4,"vTQBr9tdOFzsMkQY":1,"w9ymsB0GLrwZCPoz":6,"xiIsF5M6MiCIire4":6,"yarz3b4aNVKpKnHS":1}}}}}

This bonus increases by 1 at 5th and 9th levels. He loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.<br /><br /><strong> Ki Pool (Su)</strong>: If a student of perfection has levels in a class that grants a ki pool, his student of perfection levels stack with his levels of that class to determine his total number of ki points. If the student of perfection has a ki pool from Perfect Style, he adds his Wisdom modifier to his ki pool. The student of perfection&rsquo;s ki pool also gains ki strike as per the ki pool of a monk of a level equal to his class level. This stacks with his levels in monk (if any).<br /><br /><strong> Martial Artist (Ex)</strong>: If a student of perfection has brawler&rsquo;s flurry, fast movement, flurry of blows, stunning fist, or the unarmed strike class features from previous levels, his class levels in this prestige class stack with those levels when determining the effects of these abilities. Otherwise, a student of perfection gains flurry of blows and unarmed strike as a monk of a level equal to his student of perfection level. Levels in student of perfection count as monk levels for the purposes of feats such as Stunning Fist.<br /><br /><strong> Ki Powers (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a student of perfection can select one ki power chosen from the unchained monk (<em>Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained</em> 16) options listed directly below or from the new ki powers detailed afterward. This ki power must be open to all students of perfection or appropriate to his chosen school. If a ki power from Pathfinder Unchained is followed by a level in parentheses, use that as the minimum character level (instead of the level given in Pathfinder Unchained). All other prerequisites must be met. Unless otherwise noted, a student of perfection cannot select an individual ki power more than once.<br /><br />Any student of perfection can choose elemental fury, elemental burst (10th), or genie&rsquo;s blade (see below).<br /><br />If he belongs to the Monastery of Unblinking Flame, a student of perfection can also choose furious defense, ki hurricane (4th), sudden speed, or any of the powers below for that monastery.<br /><br />If he belongs to the Monastery of Unfolding Wind, the student of perfection can also choose high jump, ki range, wind jump, or any of the powers below for that monastery.<br /><br />If he belongs to the Monastery of Untwisting Iron, a student of perfection can also choose diamond body, diamond resilience (6th), diamond soul (6th), or any of the powers below for that monastery.<br /><br /><em> Genie&rsquo;s Blade (Su; any)</em>: The student of perfection is proficient with the falchion, kukri, and scimitar and treats these weapons as if they had the monk special quality. The student of perfection can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to give a falchion, kukri, or scimitar he wields the ki strike special ability and have it deal damage equal to that of his unarmed strikes (if greater than its base damage). The student of perfection applies his full Strength modifier to his damage rolls for these attacks. These effects last 1 round.<br /><br /><em> Inner Fire (Su; Unblinking Flame)</em>: While the student of perfection is under the effects of elemental fury (fire), a creature that successfully grapples him takes 1d6 points of fire damage. The damage increases by 1d6 each round the creature maintains the grapple, to a maximum number of dice equal to the student of perfection&rsquo;s level. A student of perfection must have the elemental fury ki power before selecting this ki power.<br /><br /><em> Iron Chain Choke (Ex; Untwisting Iron)</em>: When the student of perfection uses his iron chain strike ability, any opponent grappled by him must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + the student of perfection&rsquo;s class level + the student of perfection&rsquo;s Strength modifier) or it cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round. A student of perfection must have the iron chain strike ki power before selecting this ki power.<br /><br /><em> Iron Chain Strike (Ex; Untwisting Iron)</em>: When the student of perfection succeeds at a combat maneuver check, he can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to maintain a grapple to deal damage and can add double his Strength bonus to the damage roll.<br /><br /><em> Ki Missile (Su; Unfolding Wind)</em>: The student of perfection can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to give any thrown weapon he wields the benefits of ki strike and have it deal damage equal to that of his unarmed strikes (if greater than its base damage). These effects last 1 round.<br /><br /><em> Master of Riddles (Sp; Unblinking Flame)</em>: Bluff is a class skill for the student of perfection. When he makes a successful opposed Bluff check, the student of perfection can spend 1 ki point as a standard action to give the target a suggestion (as per the spell <em>suggestion</em>). His caster level is equal to his class level, and the save DC is 10 + his class level + his Wisdom modifier.<br /><br /><em> One in Mind and Body (Ex; Unfolding Wind)</em>: The student of perfection can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to add his Wisdom modifier as a bonus on a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check.<br /><br /><em> Punish Mistake (Ex; Unblinking Flame)</em>: When the student of perfection makes an attack of opportunity, he can spend 1 ki point as an immediate action to make an additional attack against the target that had provoked the attack.<br /><br /><em> Still Air (Sp; Unfolding Wind)</em>: The student of perfection can spend 1 ki point to cast calm emotions. His caster level is equal to his class level, and the save DC is equal to 10 + his class level + his Wisdom modifier. He can spend 3 ki points as an immediate action to use this ability on himself when he is affected by an emotion<sup>UM</sup> effect, a confusion effect, or a fear effect.<br /><br /><em> Transmute Metal (Su; Untwisting Iron)</em>: The student of perfection can spend 1 ki point and touch a metal weapon (or 50 pieces of metal ammunition), granting it the benefits of his ki strike for a number of minutes equal to his class level.<br /><br /><strong> Bonus Feat</strong>: At 3rd level, a student of perfection gains one of the following feats (see pages 106&ndash;107) based on his chosen House of Perfection: Unblinking Flame Feint, Unfolding Wind Strike, or Untwisting Iron Strength. At 7th level, he gains either Unblinking Flame Fist, Unfolding Wind Rush, or Untwisting Iron Skin. A student of perfection need not meet the prerequisites normally required for these feats.<br /><br />Alternatively, if the student of perfection has levels in a class that grants bonus feats, he can instead choose one of those bonus feats, adding his student of perfection level to his level in that class to determine available feats.<br /><br /><strong> Perfection (Ex)</strong> At 10th level, a student of perfection increases an ability score of his choice by 2.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.GZ4ZGhHPS4sR8f63","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ki Pool (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-open-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oP2K87w7eqRJ9SBg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ki Powers (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-open-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.nSMlukvKY75JaHqN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Martial Artist (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-open-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.UwFzDiBw4Ni0kHph","dataType":"compendium","name":"Perfection (Ex) ","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-open-brown.webp","level":10,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vKapZzmkqXs62B2A","dataType":"compendium","name":"AC Bonus (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-open-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.m35SWcck5WSAvNTH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Feat","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-open-brown.webp","level":3,"_index":5}]},"tag":"studentOfPerfection","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The rare few Kuthites gifted with the right to rule are known as the Umbral Court, and Umbral Court agents are their enforcers. Officially, Umbral Court agents operate primarily in the blasted city of Ridwan or the capital of Pangolais. In truth, however, Umbral Court agents operate throughout all of Nidal and its neighboring nations. Some work in the open as diplomats and consuls, others in secret as spies, agitators, and agents provocateur. Most agents in Nidal spend their time hunting down apostates and heretics, seeking to purge the nation of inappropriate inf luences. Those acting abroad seek out positions in rival nations&rsquo; halls of power. Regardless of their methods, all serve the greater glory of Nidal&mdash;and the will of their dark god&mdash;with blind devotion.<br /><br />Umbral Court agents&rsquo; loyalty to their overlords and ideals does not extend to other agents. Many an agent has fallen to a poisoned dagger from a rival seeking greater power. These minor treacheries are overlooked, or even rewarded, by superiors, so long as they do not interfere with the relative peace and order of Nidal. Agents who thirst for power often make deals with dark entities in order to stay one step ahead of their so-called allies, and in Pangolais it is not uncommon for agents to transform themselves into vampires or other types of undead.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an Umbral Court agent, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br

and Armor Proficiency</strong>: An Umbral Court agent gains proficiency with the spiked chain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PidpmqLFvf6JWOQB]{Blessings of Darkness}<br /><br /><strong>Blessings of Darkness</strong>: An Umbral Court agent gains the Darkness domain at 1st level, using his class level as his effective cleric level to determine the effects of its granted powers. If he already possesses the Darkness domain from another class, his Umbral Court agent levels stack with levels in that class when determining the effects of his Darkness domain powers. The Umbral Court agent does not receive bonus spells or domain spell slots from his Umbral Court agent levels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1jWdphZfvOQLR2cN]{Tenebrous Magic}<br /><br /><strong>Tenebrous Magic</strong>: An Umbral Court agent receives Tenebrous Spell (<em>Inner Sea Magic </em>15) as a bonus feat at 1st level, and can apply its effects to his spells without increasing their effective spell level or casting time. In addition, if the spell has the darkness or shadow descriptor or is of the illusion (shadow) subschool, the spell&rsquo;s effective caster level and any associated save DCs are increased by 2 (instead of 1), and any attempts at dispelling the spell in darkness or dim light take a &ndash;4 penalty on the dispel check (instead of &ndash;2).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.N7m9fQTtzgZAWUdb]{Umbral Courtier (Ex)}<br /><strong>Umbral Courtier (Ex)</strong>: An Umbral Court agent gains a competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Knowledge (nobility) checks equal to his class level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.VQsXN7uyYAcWgi2o]{Darkvision (Ex)}<br /><br /><strong>Darkvision (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an Umbral Court agent gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If he already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet. At 7th level, the range of the Umbral Court agent&rsquo;s darkvision increases by an additional 30 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.n8pJ5cOb4QQYABQV]{Shadow Chains (Sp)}<br /><br /><strong>Shadow Chains (Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, an Umbral Court agent can use his touch of darkness ability one additional time per day. When using the touch of darkness ability, the Umbral Court agent manifests shadowy chains that increase the reach of his melee touch attack by 5 feet. A creature struck by these chains must succeed at a Ref lex save (DC 10 + the Umbral Court agent&rsquo;s level + the Umbral Court agent&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) or be entangled for 1d4 rounds in addition to the normal effects of the ability.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.69JuYOGJPu0Qg3sr]{Shadow Jump (Su)}<br /><br /><strong>Shadow Jump (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, an Umbral Court agent gains the ability to supernaturally travel between shadows. This ability functions exactly like the shadowdancer ability of the same name.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NvdCjOAQyVCqb7Tl]{Unnerving Gaze (Su)}<br /><strong>Unnerving Gaze (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, an Umbral Court agent gains a gaze attack similar to the kyton ability of the same name. Creatures within 30 feet of the Umbral Court agent must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + the Umbral Court agent&rsquo;s level + the Umbral Court agent&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) or be shaken for 1 round. The Umbral Court agent can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his level; these rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is a swift action. The Umbral Court agent is immune to the unnerving gaze of kytons (whether or not his own unnerving gaze is active). This is a mind-affecting fear effect that follows all the normal rules for a gaze attack.<br /><br />As the Umbral Court agent gains levels, his unnerving gaze grows more potent. At 7th level, creatures that fail their save are shaken for 1d4 rounds. At 9th level, they are staggered for 1 round and shaken for 1d4 rounds after.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.A4uLypmBnc0eO1fh]{Grasping Darkness (Sp)}<br /><strong>Grasping Darkness (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, an Umbral Court agent can use his touch of darkness ability an additional time per day, and the reach provided by his shadow chains ability increases by 5 feet (to a total 10 foot increase). In place of entangling the target, the Umbral Court agent can attempt to grapple the target without provoking an attack of opportunity, using his Wisdom modifier in place of his Strength modifier for the purpose of determining his CMB. If both the Umbral Court agent and his target are in an area of dim or darker light, he gains a +5 bonus on this grapple check. The Umbral Court agent does not gain the grappled condition when using his shadow chains this way. He may make combat maneuver checks to maintain the grapple for as long as the effect of his touch of darkness ability persists.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.87CxF570xPbMuCn0]{Crushing Umbra (Sp)}<br /><br /><strong>Crushing Umbra (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, an Umbral Court agent can use his touch of darkness ability at will, and the reach provided by his shadow chains increases by another 10 feet (to a total 20 foot increase). When he successfully grapples a creature with his shadow chains, the Umbral Court agent can begin constricting his victim as a free action, dealing 5d6 points of damage whenever he makes a successful grapple check. Creatures constricted in this way are also considered strangled, and cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PidpmqLFvf6JWOQB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blessings of Darkness","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.87CxF570xPbMuCn0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Crushing Umbra (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":10,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.VQsXN7uyYAcWgi2o","dataType":"compendium","name":"Darkvision (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.A4uLypmBnc0eO1fh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Grasping Darkness (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":6,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.n8pJ5cOb4QQYABQV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Shadow Chains (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.69JuYOGJPu0Qg3sr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Shadow Jump (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1jWdphZfvOQLR2cN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tenebrous Magic","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.N7m9fQTtzgZAWUdb","dataType":"compendium","name":"Umbral Courtier (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":1,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NvdCjOAQyVCqb7Tl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unnerving Gaze (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-trip.jpg","level":5,"_index":8}]},"tag":"umbralCourtAgent","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"Spiked Chain"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

These prodigious thieves blend the subtlest aspects of the arcane with the natural cunning of the bandit and the scoundrel, using spells to enhance their natural thieving abilities. Arcane tricksters can pick locks, disarm traps, and lift purses from a safe distance using their magical legerdemain, and as often as not seek humiliation as a goal to triumph over their foes than more violent solutions. <br /><br />The path to becoming an arcane trickster is a natural progression for rogues who have supplemented their talents for theft with the study of the arcane. Multiclass rogue/sorcerers and rogue/bards are the most common arcane tricksters, although other combinations are possible. Arcane tricksters are most often found in large, cosmopolitan cities where their talents for magical larceny can be most effectively put to use, prowling the streets and stealing from the unwary. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: With their mastery of magic, arcane tricksters can make for even more subtle or confounding opponents than standard rogues. Ranged legerdemain enhances their skill as thieves, and their ability to make sneak attacks without flanking or as part of a spell can make arcane tricksters formidable damage-dealers. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: All arcane tricksters have a penchant for mischief and thievery, and are therefore never lawful. Although they sometimes acquire their magical abilities through the studious path of wizardry, their magical aptitude more often stems from a sorcerous bloodline. As such, many arcane tricksters are of a chaotic alignment.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an arcane trickster, a character must fulfill all of the

tricksters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane trickster, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Ranged Legerdemain (Su)</strong>: An arcane trickster can use Disable Device and Sleight of Hand at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. She can only use this ability if she has at least 1 rank in the skill being used. <br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack</strong>: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. <br /><br /><strong>Impromptu Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack she makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack). <br /><br />At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day. <br /><br /><strong>Tricky Spells (Su)</strong>: Starting at 5th level, an arcane trickster can cast her spells without their somatic or verbal components, as if using the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats. Spells cast using this ability do not increase in spell level or casting time. She can use this ability 3 times per day at 5th level and one additional time per every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5 times per day at 9th level. The arcane trickster decides to use this ability at the time of casting. <br /><br /><strong>Invisible Thief (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, an arcane trickster can become <em>invisible</em>, as if under the effects of <em>greater invisibility</em>, as a free action. She can remain invisible for a number of rounds per day equal to her arcane trickster level. Her caster level for this effect is equal to her caster level. These rounds need not be consecutive. <br /><br /><strong>Surprise Spells</strong>: At 10th level, an arcane trickster can add her sneak attack damage to any spell that deals damage, if the targets are flat-footed.

Proficiency</strong>: A Pathfinder field agent gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Pathfinder Training</strong>: A Pathfinder field agent receives additional training that aids her in her fulfilling her duty to explore, report, and cooperate. She can&rsquo;t receive the same training more than once unless otherwise noted. A Pathfinder field agent gains additional Pathfinder training at 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter.<br /><br /><em>Animal Magnetism (Ex)</em>: This ability functions as the druid&rsquo;s wild empathy class ability, except the Pathfinder field agent&rsquo;s effective druid level to determine her wild empathy bonus is equal to her Pathfinder field agent level. Levels in Pathfinder field agent stack with levels from other classes that grant wild empathy for the purpose of determining a Pathfinder field agent&rsquo;s total wild empathy bonus.<br /><br /><em>Deft Defender (Ex)</em>: When the Pathfinder field agent successfully uses the aid another action to increase an ally&rsquo;s Armor Class, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to her AC until the start of her next turn.<br /><br /><em>Eidetic Memory (Ex)</em>: Years of training in the libraries of countless Pathfinder lodges have given the Pathfinder field agent extraordinary recall. A Pathfinder field agent with this training adds half her class level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge skill checks and can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.<br /><br /><em>Greater Casting</em>: The Pathfinder field agent gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She doesn&rsquo;t gain other benefits of that class other than spells per day, spells known, and an increased caster level. If the Pathfinder field agent has levels in more than one spellcasting class, she must choose which class to apply this increase to when she takes this Pathfinder training.<br /><br /><em>Know Thy Enemy (Ex)</em>: The Pathfinder field agent can select one creature type, and gains a +5 bonus on Knowledge checks to identify creatures of the chosen type. This can be taken more than once, and applies to a different creature type each time.<br /><br /><em>Rogue Talent</em>: The Pathfinder field agent can select any rogue talent for which she qualifies.<br /><br /><em>Skill Specialization (Ex)</em>: The Pathfinder field agent can select any skill to become a class skill for her. In addition, she gains a bonus on checks with the chosen skill equal to half her class level. This training can be selected more than once, applying to a different skill each time it is taken.<br /><br /><em>Sneak Attack +1d6 (Ex)</em>: This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. If the Pathfinder field agent gains a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. A Pathfinder field agent must be at least 3rd level before selecting this training.<br /><br /><em>Trapfinding</em>: This training functions as the rogue class feature of the same name. Levels in Pathfinder field agent stack with levels from other classes that grant this ability for the purpose of determining a Pathfinder field agent&rsquo;s total trapfinding bonus.<br /><br /><strong>Wayfinder Upgrade</strong>: At 1st level and every 3 levels thereafter, a Pathfinder field agent can add an additional ability to her <em>wayfinder</em>. These abilities must be added to a standard <em>wayfinder </em>(see <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide</em> 299), not to a variant or modified <em>wayfinder </em>(though a Pathfinder field agent can possess more than one <em>wayfinder </em>at a time, if she chooses). If a Pathfinder field agent loses her upgraded <em>wayfinder</em>, she can purchase a new one at the normal cost plus 100 gp for each Pathfinder field agent level she possesses, keeping all previously selected upgrades. A Pathfinder field agent can choose from the listed <em>wayfinder </em>upgrades. Any upgrades that grant additional spell effects use the <em>wayfinder&rsquo;s</em> caster level or the Pathfinder field agent&rsquo;s class level (whichever is higher) to determine effects that depend on caster level.<br /><br /><em>Dancing Lights</em>: The Pathfinder replaces her <em>wayfinder&rsquo;s</em> ability to cast <em>light </em>with the ability to cast<em> dancing lights </em>at will.<br /><br /><em>Daylight</em>: Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent can use her <em>wayfinder </em>to cast <em>daylight</em>. This upgrade can be selected more than once. Each additional time it&rsquo;s selected, the Pathfinder field agent gains another use of the spell per day.<br /><br /><em>Flask</em>: A hidden compartment is carved into the <em>wayfinder&rsquo;s </em>casing, allowing a single potion, oil, or dose of poison to be hidden within. This substance can be retrieved with a swift action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity (as opposed to the normal move action required to retrieve a stored item). Drinking the potion or applying the oil or poison still requires a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The Pathfinder field agent gains a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to oppose the Perception check of someone observing or frisking her to detect items in the hidden compartment.<br /><br /><em>Hidden</em>: In order to hide her affiliation with the Pathfinder Society from potential enemies, a Pathfinder field agent with this upgrade can, three times per day, turn her <em>wayfinder </em>invisible and mask its magical aura as if it were under the effects of <em>invisibility </em>and <em>magic aura</em>. Each time this effect is used, it lasts for up to 1 hour per 2 class levels the Pathfinder field agent possesses (minimum 1 hour), and can be dismissed by the Pathfinder field agent as a move action.<br /><br /><em>Message</em>: In addition to the <em>light </em>spell-like ability, the <em>wayfinder </em>can be used to cast <em>message </em>at will. <br /><br /><em>Shielding</em>: Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent can activate her <em>wayfinder </em>to gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC for a number of minutes equal to her Pathfinder field agent level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 class levels the Pathfinder field agent possesses. <br /><br /><em>Silence</em>: Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent can use her <em>wayfinder </em>to emit an aura of <em>silence</em>, as the spell. The <em>silence</em> effect must be centered on the <em>wayfinder</em>. This upgrade can be selected more than once. Each additional time the upgrade is selected, the agent gains another use of the spell per day.<br /><br /><em>Stabilize</em>: The wayfinder can be used to cast <em>stabilize </em>at will.<br /><br /><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a Pathfinder field agent can select a bonus feat. Each of these bonus feats must be Skill Focus or a teamwork feat. The Pathfinder field agent must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.<br /><br /><strong>Legends Uncovered (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Pathfinder field agent has the ability to uncover the secrets of the distant past. Once per day when studying or researching a person, place, or artifact of antiquity, the agent can dedicate herself to the task to gain benefits as though she were casting the spell <em>legend lore</em>.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ciyImu4uU8FDRucB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wayfinder Upgrade","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-marked-green.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.awikzWDddpbaic29","dataType":"compendium","name":"Pathfinder Training","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-marked-green.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Mr6GVy8LAe5sNi7v","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Feat","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-marked-green.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3MTERYJoDdLsOZo6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Legends Uncovered (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-marked-green.webp","level":10,"_index":3}]},"tag":"pathfinderFieldAgent","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

All things must ebb and f low, and nothing is exempt from the endless cycle of life, death, decay, and rebirth.<br /><br />Adherents of the Green Faith follow a strict hierarchy that ref lects their philosophy of ecological equilibrium. The top leadership comprises only a strict few individuals, their positions secured through a system of challenges made by lesser-ranked initiates against higher-ups in the same way a potential rival must challenge the alpha of an animal pack. The form a particular challenge takes depends on the terms the challenger and her opponent agree upon. Some are fierce battles to the death, and others melee duels or contests of spellcasting. Nonviolent challenges could be tests of biological knowledge, competitive hunts, racing events, or even challenges involving nurturing a rare plant or endangered animal.<br /><br />Members of the Green Faith fiercely oppose the unnatural, including living or undead abominations that have no place in the natural order. Renowned for their impartiality, Green Faith acolytes commonly serve as judges, ambassadors, or mediators between opposing parties.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to

If she has no animal companion, she instead gains a druid animal companion, treating her effective druid level as 1/2 her class level (minimum 1).<br /><br /><strong>Wild Empathy (Ex)</strong>: This ability is identical to the druid class ability. For the purpose of this ability, a Green Faith acolyte&rsquo;s class level stacks with levels in any other class that grants the wild empathy ability.<br /><br /><strong>Wild Link (Su)</strong>: At the indicated levels, a Green Faith acolyte increases her effective druid level by 1 for determining the powers and uses per day of her wild shape ability. If a Green Faith acolyte doesn&rsquo;t have the wild shape class ability, she instead gains the wild shape ability of a 4th-level druid when she has a wild link bonus of +4, increasing her effective druid level by 1 for each iteration of this ability beyond +4.<br /><br /><strong>Hibernate (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Green Faith acolyte can enter a state of suspended animation as a full-round action. This state is similar to the effect of <em>sepia snake sigil</em>, except that the Green Faith acolyte is aware of changes in her surroundings or harm to her body as if deeply asleep. She can end this state at any time as a full-round action. If she remains in hibernation for at least a week before emerging, her body is renewed as if by both a <em>heal </em>spell and a <em>restoration </em>spell. A Green Faith acolyte can remain in this state for up to 1 week per class level, after which she must wait 1 day for each week spent hibernating before entering hibernation again.<br /><br /><strong>Power over Nature (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, when a Green Faith acolyte&rsquo;s divine spell deals hit point damage to or heals hit point damage for a creature of the animal, fey, or plant type, it deals or heals additional hit point damage equal to the spell&rsquo;s level.<br /><br /><strong>Animal Covenant (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, when casting a divine spell with an area affect, a Green Faith acolyte can choose a number of animals within the spell&rsquo;s area equal to her Wisdom or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher (minimum 1). These animals are excluded from the spell&rsquo;s effects. If the spell has a duration longer than instantaneous, the animals are protected against the spell for only a number of rounds equal to the Green Faith acolyte&rsquo;s class level.<br /><br /><strong>Venom Immunity (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a Green Faith acolyte gains immunity to all poisons.<br /><br /><strong>Blighter of Abominations (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, when a divine spell cast by the Green Faith acolyte affects a creature of the aberration type, she treats the spell as if it had been modified by the Sickening Spell<sup>APG</sup> metamagic feat. When a divine spell cast by the Green Faith acolyte harms an undead creature, she treats the spell as if it had been modified by the Empower Spell metamagic feat. The spell affects other creature types normally. This ability doesn&rsquo;t increase the spell&rsquo;s casting time or spell level.<br /><br /><strong>Archdruid</strong>: At 8th level, a Green Faith acolyte can become an Archdruid if there&rsquo;s a vacancy in her region, or if she seeks out and bests an existing Archdruid in hand-tohand combat, a competition of spells, or some other formal contest. If, after gaining the title, she loses a similar challenge from a rival, she loses the title of Archdruid. She also gives up the title of Archdruid upon becoming a Great Druid. A Green Faith acolyte must attain the title of Archdruid before she can progress to 9th level.<br /><br /><strong>Great Druid</strong>: At 9th level, a Green Faith acolyte can gain or lose the title of Great Druid in a manner similar to the way a Green Faith acolyte can gain or lose the title of Archdruid. She gives up the title of Great Druid upon becoming a Grand Druid. A Green Faith acolyte must attain the title of Great Druid before she can progress to 10th level.<br /><br /><strong>Grand Druid (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Green Faith acolyte can gain or lose the title of Grand Druid in a manner similar to the way a Green Faith acolyte can gain or lose the title of Archdruid. Each day, the Grand Druid can prepare a total of 10 additional spell levels of divine spells, or cast up to 10 additional levels of divine spells if she is a spontaneous spellcaster, chosen from spell levels she is already capable of casting. She loses this ability if she loses the title of Grand Druid.<br /><br /><strong>Longevity (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a Green Faith acolyte&rsquo;s maximum age increases by 20%.<br /><br /><strong>Timeless Body (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a Green Faith acolyte no longer takes penalties for aging. This functions exactly like the druid ability of the same name.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Q1yghDHcg2y2U8Zo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wild Link (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.GjWHYXf21LfdVUda","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wild Empathy (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.N5AR6U6lJnB1WJ21","dataType":"compendium","name":"Venom Immunity (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":6,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.p2krvooKjLTuoQGN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Power over Nature (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":4,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.D6ch9JdtomjEewPK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Longevity (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":10,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Zx0qGZhvAn7jJcUn","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hibernate (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8u2SyPNKjMwENMWS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Great Druid","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":9,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mDBmkdnz3igJOCTT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Grand Druid (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":10,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.yu1PiDayvyqCm4rb","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blighter of Abominations (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":7,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zuxeB62NolUimBs2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Archdruid","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":8,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Z8tRBYY130P3HkqB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Animal Covenant (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":5,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sRwTIfquyDXsY6Uf","dataType":"compendium","name":"Companion Bond (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":1,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TPrvvB6UluI4xvAH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Timeless Body (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_10.jpg","level":10,"_index":12}]},"tag":"greenFaithAcolyte","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Rogues who specialize in stealth and poisons might swear allegiance to Norgorber, while wandering bards sing songs in praise of Desna. Even the most powerful deity is not too proud to turn such followers aside, for the worship of passionate acolytes is precious regardless of their backgrounds, professions, races, or ages, and they might lead others to the faith by example. These unusual but skillful followers of the gods are called evangelists.<br /><br />An evangelist could have a childhood rooted in wealth or poverty, hail from the north or the south, and may have been raised in her faith or come to it late in life. She may follow one path strictly or dabble in multiple professions. She may be of any race and pledge her faith to any of the core deities. Of all the preeminent followers of the core deities, the evangelist is the hardest to predict and shows the most variety in her abilities.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an evangelist, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Within one step of chosen deity.<br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Must worship a single, specific deity.

following are class features of the evangelist prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: An evangelist is proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. An evangelist also gains weapon proficiency with her chosen deity&rsquo;s favored weapon.<br /><br /><strong>Obedience (Ex)</strong>: In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class, including all abilities gained from aligned class (see below), an evangelist must perform a daily obedience to her chosen deity (see the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/DeitiesByGroup.aspx\">deity's page</a> for more information).<br /><br /><strong>Skilled</strong>: Evangelists possess a range of skills across multiple disciplines. At 1st level, an evangelist selects two skills to add to her class skill list. Once selected, these class skills can&rsquo;t be changed.<br /><br /><strong>Aligned Class (Ex)</strong>: Evangelists come from many different backgrounds, and they show an unusual range of diversity. At 2nd level, the evangelist must choose a class she belonged to before adding the prestige class to be her aligned class. She gains all the class features for this class, essentially adding every evangelist level beyond 1st to her aligned class to determine what class features she gains. She still retains the Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks of the prestige class, but gains all other class features of her aligned class as well as those of the evangelist prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Protective Grace (Su)</strong>: The evangelist&rsquo;s chosen deity rewards her with heightened awareness and reaction skills, making her more difficult to strike in combat. At 2nd level, the evangelist gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 7th level. The evangelist loses this bonus when she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Boon</strong>: As the evangelist gains levels, she gains boons from her chosen deity. The nature of these boons varies depending on the evangelist&rsquo;s chosen deity. Each deity grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the evangelist gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Deific%20Obedience\">Deific Obedience</a> feat and her deity's description for details on these divine boons. When a divine boon grants a spell-like ability, the evangelist&rsquo;s caster level for the spell-like ability equals her total character level. This ability allows an evangelist to access these boons earlier than with the Deific Obedience feat alone; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.<br /><br /><strong>Gift of Tongues</strong>: At 4th level, the evangelist may select a new language as a gift from her chosen deity. She gains the ability to speak and write this new language fluently, so as to better communicate with those she meets in the course of her travels. At 8th level, the evangelist selects a second language to learn. The ability to comprehend these languages is an instantaneous divine gift, and spells and effects that dispel persistent effects can&rsquo;t remove the evangelist&rsquo;s gift of tongues.<br /><br /><strong>Multitude of Talents (Ex)</strong>: The evangelist finds herself in many strange situations requiring a variety of skills. Starting at 5th level, the evangelist gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on any skill check attempted with a skill in which the character has no ranks. This bonus applies only to skill checks that can be made untrained.<br /><br /><strong>Spiritual Form (Su)</strong>: Upon reaching 10th level, the evangelist gains the ability to assume a spiritual form. Assuming this form is a standard action, and the evangelist can remain in spiritual form for a number of minutes per day equal to her character level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Returning to her normal form is a free action.<br /><br />The evangelist&rsquo;s spiritual form grants her telepathy to a range of 100 feet, as well as two variable abilities. Upon reaching 10th level, the evangelist must choose the form of these two abilities, and once she has selected them they can&rsquo;t be changed. First, she chooses one ability score to which she gains a +4 bonus when in spiritual form. Second, she chooses one physical transformation from the following to gain when she transforms: wings (fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or a single natural attack (a claw, bite, gore, slam, or tail sting that deals damage as appropriate for the evangelist&rsquo;s size) as well as a temporary appendage capable of making such an attack if necessary.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.CPz8QrQRSTdYF8IU","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spiritual Form (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-cross.webp","level":10,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ipNepAJ42lQD7U1z","dataType":"compendium","name":"Skilled","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-cross.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QyCuPG69WyxYp70i","dataType":"compendium","name":"Protective Grace (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-cross.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9uW6yTDHEqxFeuiS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Obedience (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-cross.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Z39adRYki95K4OoP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Multitude of Talents (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-cross.webp","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3JZ7e9B5rm1wH6zu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Gift of Tongues","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-cross.webp","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.dydAz0LIi5wjPdcw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aligned Class (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-cross.webp","level":2,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kARaCM0KeIkwxJDO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Boon","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-red-cross.webp","level":3,"_index":7}]},"tag":"evangelist","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":"deity’s favored weapon"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The crimson templars of Ragathiel are taught that mercy is a virtue reserved for only those capable of accepting redemption.

The crimson templar then gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks against that outsider, and a +2 bonus on weapon attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against it. The DCs of crimson templar class abilities against that opponent increase by 2. A crimson templar can maintain these bonuses against only one evil outsider at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the outsider is dead or the crimson templar studies a new evil outsider.<br /><br />If a crimson templar deals sneak attack damage to an evil outsider, he can study that target as an immediate action, allowing him to apply his fiendish studies bonuses against that target (including to the weapon damage roll). At 2nd level, a crimson templar can study an evil outsider as a move or swift action.<br /><br />At 5th and 10th levels, the bonuses on weapon attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks and to the DCs of crimson templar abilities against an evil outsider increase by 2. In addition, at 5th level and 10th levels, the crimson templar is able to maintain these bonuses against an additional evil outsider at the same time. The crimson templar can end these bonuses as a free action, allowing him to study another target.<br /><br />The bonuses from fiendish studies stack with any bonuses gained from the slayer&rsquo;s studied target ability or a ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy ability.<br /><br /><strong>Obedience</strong>: At 1st level, a crimson templar gains Deific Obedience<sup>ISG</sup> as a bonus feat. If the crimson templar already has this feat or Celestial Obedience (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Chronicle of the Righteous 5</em>), he instead gains a bonus combat feat.<br /><br /><strong>Shield of Wings (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a crimson templar gains fire resistance 5. This increases to fire resistance 10 at 3rd level, increases to fire resistance 30 at 6th level, and becomes immunity to fire at 9th level. As a swift action, a crimson templar can manifest a set of five burning wings from his back to gain a fly speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability) for a number of minutes equal to his crimson templar level. He can dismiss these wings as a move action, but any remaining duration is lost. While the crimson templar has these wings, and for a number of minutes equal to the number of minutes the crimson templar had wings after the duration ends or the wings are dismissed, the crimson templar does not have the fire resistance or immunity granted by shield of wings.<br /><br /><strong>Ruthlessness (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a crimson templar can use a bastard sword to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless opponent as a standard action.<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This ability is like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt is 1d6 at 2nd level and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. If a crimson templar gains sneak attack from another source, the bonuses to damage stack.<br /><br /><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: At 3rd level, 6th level, and 9th level, the crimson templar gains a bonus combat feat. He must still meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Boon</strong>: At 4th level, the crimson templar gains Ragathiel&rsquo;s first boon. At 7th level, he gains the second boon. At 10th level, he gains the third boon. This ability allows the crimson templar to access these boons earlier than with the Deific Obedience or Celestial Obedience feat alone; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally. Ragathiel&rsquo;s boons are detailed on page 21 of <em>Chronicle of the Righteous</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Heavenly Fire (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, the crimson templar can incinerate unaware evil foes with pure celestial flame. If the crimson templar deals sneak attack damage to a creature he has successfully used his fiendish studies ability on, the sneak attack wreathes the target in crimson fire. The target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the crimson templar&rsquo;s class level + his Charisma modifier). If the target fails this save, it takes an additional 1d6 points of damage per class level the crimson templar has. Half of this damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to fire-based attacks. On a successful save, the target takes the sneak attack damage as normal but does not take any of the heavenly fire damage. A crimson templar can use heavenly fire a number of times per day equal to his crimson templar level.<br /><br /><strong>Immolate (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, whenever the crimson templar reduces a creature with an evil alignment to negative hit points with a sneak attack or coup de grace, the target must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the crimson templar&rsquo;s class level + his Charisma modifier). If the target fails this save, it is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine ash (as per disintegrate). If an evil target is reduced to negative hit points from the heavenly fire ability, it receives no saving throw against this effect. This ability has no effect if the target does not have an evil alignment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ex-Crimson Templars</h2>\n<p>A crimson templar who ceases to be lawful good or who kills any creature with a good alignment loses all crimson templar class features. He can&rsquo;t progress any further in levels as a crimson templar.

The wizards&rsquo; conflict came to a close during the Age of Enthronement with the undeath of Geb and the disappearance of Nex, and soul wardens fell into obscurity as those armies effectively dissolved.

/><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Soul wardens gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a soul warden gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he&rsquo;s a spontaneous caster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If he had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a soul warden, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Channel Damage (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a soul warden gains the power to harm undead with positive energy. This ability functions exactly like a cleric&rsquo;s ability to channel positive energy to deal damage to undead (but not to heal living creatures), and counts as channel energy for the purposes of qualifying for feats or determining effects that rely on channel energy. A soul warden uses his class level as his effective cleric level when channeling damage. He can channel damage a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Soul warden levels stack with levels in any class that grants channel energy for the purpose of determining the number of damage dice his channel energy ability deals to undead (if any).<br /><br /><strong>Focus Item</strong>: A soul warden focuses his powers through an object called a focus item. A soul warden must be able to present his focus item to channel damage or to cast spells that require a divine focus. Common focus items include amulets, bells, holy symbols, and staves.<br /><br /><strong>Channel Casting (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a soul warden can expend a use of his channel damage ability to spontaneously cast from a select group of spells. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a soul warden gains access to a number of additional spells he can cast in this manner. The spells a soul warden can cast with this ability (and the soul warden level necessary to cast such spells) are listed below.<br /><br /></p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td><em>Decompose corpse</em><sup>UM</sup>, <em>detect undead</em>, <em>hide from undead</em>, <em>sanctify corpse</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td><em>Command undead</em>, <em>necromantic burden</em> (see page 27)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td><em>Disrupting weapon</em>, <em>halt undead</em>, <em>searing light</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td><em>Death ward</em>, <em>undeath inversion</em> (see page 27), <em>wall of fire</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td><em>Breath of life</em>, <em>heal</em>, <em>undeath to death</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />Starting at 3rd level, a soul warden adds his channel casting spells gained from the previous level to the class spell list of a class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. The spell level is equal to half the soul warden level necessary to channel cast the spell. For example, a 3rdlevel spell warden who also has levels in sorcerer adds the <em>decompose corpse</em><sup>UM</sup>, <em>detect undead</em>, <em>hide from undead</em>, and <em>sanctify corpse </em>to his sorcerer spell list, treating them as 1st-level sorcerer spells (since half of 2nd level is 1st level).<br /><br /><strong>Corpse Whisperer (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a soul warden adds half his soul warden level on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks against undead creatures, including checks to assume control of undead creatures via feats like Command Undead or spells like <em>control undead</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Bonus Feats</strong>: At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a soul warden gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be chosen from the following: Channel Smite, Ectoplasmic Spell<sup>APG</sup>, Greater Channel Smite<sup>UC</sup>, Quick Channel<sup>UM</sup>, Threnodic Spell<sup>UM</sup>, Turn Undead, and Undead Master. The soul warden must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.<br /><br /><strong>Harvest (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a soul warden destroys an undead creature using channel positive energy, channel damage, or a spell with an instantaneous duration, he regains a use of channel damage. A soul warden can regain only one use of channel damage per round, and can regain a number of uses of channel damage per day up to his class level. A soul warden cannot use this to exceed his maximum number of uses of channel damage per day.<br /><br /><strong>Undead Imposition (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, as a standard action a soul warden may expend one use of channel damage to control an undead creature within 30 feet. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the soul warden&rsquo;s level + the soul warden&rsquo;s Cha modifier). Failure means the creature falls under the soul warden&rsquo;s control, obeying his commands to the best of its ability for a number of rounds equal to the soul warden&rsquo;s class level. This ability is otherwise identical to <em>control undead</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Negative Energy Ward (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, once per day a soul warden can ward a 15-foot-radius area centered on himself to protect it against undead incursions. Any undead creatures with fewer Hit Dice than his caster level cannot enter the warded area. Undead with Hit Dice greater than or equal to the soul warden&rsquo;s caster level must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + soul warden&rsquo;s level) when entering the area. An undead that succeeds at its save is unharmed, and is immune to the soul warden&rsquo;s negative energy ward for 24 hours. Failure means the creature takes 3d6 points of positive energy damage when it enters the area and it becomes staggered for 1d4 rounds. Once placed, a negative energy ward cannot be moved. The ward lasts 1 minute per soul warden level.<br /><br /><strong>Necrotic Resistance (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a soul warden becomes resistant to ability drain and negative levels. Whenever a soul warden is targeted by an effect that would result in ability drain or impose negative levels, he takes 1 point of ability drain fewer and gains 1 negative level fewer than he normally would (to a minimum of 0). At 10th level, he takes 2 fewer points of ability drain and gains 2 fewer negative levels than he normally would.<br /><br /><strong>Life Shell (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, a soul warden can create a dome of energy that repels undead creatures. This ability functions identically to <em>antilife shell</em>, except it hedges out only undead creatures and not creatures of any other type. Living creatures within the affected area gain fast healing 1 for the duration of the effect. A soul warden can activate this spell-like ability for up to 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive, but it must be expended in 1-minute increments.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.e5QDlVKHxSq7krZI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Feats","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":3,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.u4tWdYS7PVwXKWhO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Channel Casting (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qsJ4iwH2GFmClWkq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Channel Damage (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FvnpkGV7FrYGRnYE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Corpse Whisperer (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ZUR4INSpYgSl6pyh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Focus Item","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cjWQZUR1syq4kU6V","dataType":"compendium","name":"Harvest (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Q1C0ascAtALGvP3O","dataType":"compendium","name":"Life Shell (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":10,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TYWgVq4HfrMCunW4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Necrotic Resistance (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":8,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.dGPTkDAaFjAo6n35","dataType":"compendium","name":"Negative Energy Ward (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":7,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.bfJqbtdGx3FTs0E3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Undead Imposition (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_01.jpg","level":5,"_index":9}]},"tag":"soulWarden","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Perhaps even more exhausting are the moral and ethical choices a Twilight Talon has to make on so many of her missions. Often, such choices end up being difficult decisions made between two evils, and in many cases, a Twilight Talon ends up having to deal with the consequences of such decisions for months or even years to come. Yet to make no decision at all in such a time is perhaps the greatest evil of all, for to the Twilight Talon, acting in the best of intentions is always a better option than remaining quiet and allowing evil and cruelty to continue unopposed. Being selected to serve as a Twilight Talon is an honor bestowed on only the select few who Marshal Helena Trellis, head of the Talons, believes trustworthy enough to carry out the commitment and of strong enough character to be able to make morally difficult decisions for the best of Andoran&mdash;all without public recognition. To a Twilight Talon, a job well done is one that no one outside of the Talons ever knew occurred in the first place.<br /><br />A candidate for the Twilight Talons rarely meets her commanding officer in person&mdash;it&rsquo;s only after she&rsquo;s been accepted into the fold that she begins to learn details about others in the group, and even then, only on a need-to-know basis. Twilight Talons train carefully in the arts of intrigue and spycraft, but they also endeavor to keep their combat skills up to snuff so that when the perfect opportunity arises, they are prepared to take swift and brutal advantage. When on a mission for the group, a Twilight Talon might tell friends and family that she&rsquo;s leaving under some false pretense, but more often she just disappears for months or even years at a time. When a Twilight Talon works with a group of like-minded allies (as is the case when one works with an adventuring group), she may or may not reveal her true allegiance to her companions, but if she does, she must be prepared for the repercussions if those she trusts as allies do not keep her secret.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Twilight Talon, a

features of the Twilight Talon prestige class.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9aMzfPLzQlBglnOV]{Many Hats (Ex)}<br /><strong> Many Hats (Ex)</strong>: A Twilight Talon is often required to take the role of a specific profession for the purpose of getting close to a target while remaining inconspicuous, becoming an everyday part of that target&rsquo;s life until the time to strike arrives. As long as a Twilight Talon is within 60 feet of another character with ranks in Profession (architect, barrister, clerk, courtesan, driver, engineer, innkeeper, librarian, merchant, or scribe), the Twilight Talon can pick up cues and practices in performing that job, and can use her Sense Motive check in place of that particular Profession check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.DmQLMv7pbQ7Yl06u]{Sneak Attack}<br /><br /><strong> Sneak Attack</strong>: This functions as the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. If a Twilight Talon gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses to damage stack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br />@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TVs8XtTBIoL0lcdU]{Enhanced Tattoo (Sp)}<br /><strong> Enhanced Tattoo (Sp)</strong>: As a Twilight Talon gains levels, her Twilight Tattoo feat gains enhancements, allowing her to use certain spell-like abilities. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the Twilight Talon gains access to one of the spells listed for that level as a spell-like ability: 2nd level&mdash;<em>disguise self</em> or <em>undetectable alignment</em>; 4th level&mdash; <em>alter self</em> or <em>invisibility</em>; 6th level&mdash;<em>glibness</em> or <em>secret page</em>; 8th level&mdash;<em>modify memory</em> or <em>zone of silence</em>; 10th level&mdash;<em>mislead</em> or <em>seeming</em>. These spell-like abilities function at a caster level equal to the Twilight Talon&rsquo;s character level, and each ability can be used once per day. The save DC for these spell like abilities is 10 + half the Twilight Talon&rsquo;s level + her Charisma modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br />@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hlMtSs6hjw7WDeEo]{Resourceful Agent (Ex)}<br /><strong> Resourceful Agent (Ex)</strong>: A Twilight Talon often can&rsquo;t risk carrying traditional weapons, as doing so would seem out of place for many of the covers that she employs. Instead, she becomes a master at maximizing the potential in everyday objects used as improvised weapons. At 2nd level, a Twilight Talon increases the amount of damage she deals with improvised weapons by one step (for example, 1d4 becomes 1d6). At 5th level, all improvised weapons used by a Twilight Talon have a base critical threat range of 19&ndash;20, and she gains Critical Focus as a bonus feat. At 9th level, a Twilight Talon gains Staggering Critical as a bonus feat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br />@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.BBRnJFFsFaVL6eqO]{Eye for Detail (Ex)}<br /><strong> Eye for Detail (Ex)</strong>: Part of a Twilight Talon&rsquo;s training is the extensive study of the most common bureaucratic documents in Golarion&rsquo;s major nations, allowing her to accurately forge documents. At 3rd level, when forging a document associated with any government, she automatically receives a +8 bonus on Linguistics checks to create a forgery (as though she had seen a similar document before).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br />@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NMx9z5XGkClwBrx3]{Dead Drop (Ex)}<br /><strong> Dead Drop (Ex)</strong>: A Twilight Talon prepares for many contingencies and can tap her underground network for supplies, provided she pays into her dead drop fund beforehand. At 5th level, by spending an hour spreading around coin in any small town or larger settlement, the Twilight Talon gains the ability to access dead drops of equipment in the field. A Twilight Talon can pay any amount into her dead drop fund when she does so, but can never have more than a total of 100 gp per class level in her dead drop fund.<br /><br />A dead drop functions as an emergency cache of gear that any Twilight Talon agent can access while in the field. Part of the process of paying into the fund includes arranging dead drop locations in areas that the Twilight Talon suspects she may visit in the future. At any point in a wilderness region, but no more often than once per day, the Twilight Talon can take 1d8 hours to seek out the closest dead drop, at which point she can purchase any item from the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em> from the dead drop, deducting the price from the amount of gold she has paid into the fund at that date. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, gear from other sourcebooks may also be available in a dead drop. In particularly remote locations, a GM may rule that no dead drops can exist, but the GM should inform the Twilight Talon of this fact when expeditions to such areas are planned. Dead drops shift locations often, so each time a Twilight Talon seeks one out, she must spend the 1d8 hours to find it.<br /><br />At 8th level, it takes a Twilight Talon only 10 minutes to pay into her dead drop fund, it takes only 30 minutes to locate a dead drop in the wild, and her maximum dead drop fund increases to 2,500 gp. (This total does not increase when she gains additional levels.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br />@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.iPp5gQsb8vtC4smW]{Unassuming Presence (Su)}<br /><strong> Unassuming Presence (Su)</strong>: A Twilight Talon learns to quickly direct attention away from herself using subtle physical cues. At 6th level, a Twilight Talon can attempt an opposed Bluff check as a swift action against each enemy creature within 30 feet. If she succeeds against every target, the Twilight Talon can immediately attempt a Stealth check as though she had concealment; she gains a bonus equal to her Twilight Talon class level on this Stealth check. She can use this ability up to three times per day.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9aMzfPLzQlBglnOV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Many Hats (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-teal.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.DmQLMv7pbQ7Yl06u","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-teal.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TVs8XtTBIoL0lcdU","dataType":"compendium","name":"Enhanced Tattoo (Sp)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-teal.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hlMtSs6hjw7WDeEo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Resourceful Agent (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-teal.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.BBRnJFFsFaVL6eqO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eye for Detail (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-teal.webp","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NMx9z5XGkClwBrx3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dead Drop (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-teal.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.iPp5gQsb8vtC4smW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unassuming Presence (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hood-cloth-teal.webp","level":6,"_index":6}]},"tag":"twilightTalon","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Proficiency</strong>: An exalted gains weapon proficiency with her chosen deity&rsquo;s favored weapon.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day/Spells Known</strong>: At the indicated levels, an exalted gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before taking the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an exalted, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Brand (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a mark appears somewhere on the exalted&rsquo;s body. The mark&rsquo;s location varies by individual and by faith, but the mark clearly represents the exalted&rsquo;s chosen deity. The divine brand generally appears in a location easy to display, such as on the hand, forearm, chest, or face. An uncovered divine brand functions as a silver holy (or unholy) symbol. If the divine brand is forcibly removed from an unwilling exalted, it reappears on her body 24 hours later.<br /><br /><strong>Obedience (Ex)</strong>: In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by this prestige class), an exalted must perform a daily obedience to the deity she worships (see page 10).<br /><br /><strong>Scholar (Ex)</strong>: The exalted come from many backgrounds and study different aspects of their chosen faiths. At 1st level, an exalted may select one additional Knowledge skill to add to her list of class skills.<br /><br /><strong>Vitality (Su)</strong>: Divine energy suffuses the body of the exalted, making her more resilient. At 2nd level, the exalted gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus on Fortitude saves and on Constitution checks to stabilize.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Boon</strong>: As the exalted gains levels, she gains boons from her chosen deity. The nature of these boons varies depending on the exalted&rsquo;s chosen deity. Each deity grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the exalted gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the Deific Obedience feat on page 210 and the core deity descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these divine boons. When a divine boon grants a spell-like ability, the exalted&rsquo;s caster level for the spell-like ability equals her total character level. This ability allows an exalted to access these boons earlier than with the Deific Obedience feat alone; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.<br /><br /><strong>Religious Speaker (Ex)</strong>: Through her intense studies, meditation, and discussions with other worshipers, the exalted has mastered the art of speaking about her faith. At 4th level, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Perform (oratory) checks while her divine brand is visible.<br /><br /><strong>Expanded Portfolio (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, the exalted further increases her already impressive knowledge of her chosen deity&rsquo;s faith and is rewarded with increased powers in one of the spheres over which her deity holds sway. The exalted chooses a domain of her chosen deity to which she gains access, using her exalted level as her effective cleric level.<br /><br />The exalted can also can use each of the chosen domain&rsquo;s spells once per day as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to her exalted level. The exalted can use each spell-like ability only if she is able to cast divine spells of that level. If the exalted has any domain spell slots, she is also able to cast the chosen domain&rsquo;s spells in those slots as normal.<br /><br /><strong>Aspect of Divinity (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, the exalted gains a physical trait that reflects her faith. These physical traits vary by individual and deity; examples include hair with the appearance of fire or water, scaled or metallic f lesh, talons, reptilian or glowing eyes, or a faint and colorful aura. The traits may be obvious or subtle, but in any case they confer no special attacks or abilities and impose a &ndash;4 penalty on Disguise checks.<br /><br />In addition, the exalted gains a permanent <em>protection from chaos/evil/good/law </em>effect with a caster level equal to her character level. She must select one alignment from which her aura protects her, and the chosen alignment must be opposed to the exalted&rsquo;s alignment (and therefore her deity&rsquo;s). An exalted who is neutral chooses any of the four alignments. Once the exalted makes this choice, it can&rsquo;t be changed.<br /><br /><strong>Ardent Vision (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, the exalted can always discern the enemies of her faith. She gains the ability to cast <em>detect chaos/evil/good/law </em>at will, with a caster level equal to her character level. The exalted must choose one alignment to detect that is opposed to her alignment (or one of her choice is if she is neutral), and once this choice is made it can&rsquo;t be changed.<br /><br /><strong>Perform Miracle (Su)</strong>: The exalted at the pinnacle of her abilities can create effects that are nothing short of miraculous. At 10th level, once per day the exalted can do one of the following things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duplicate any cleric spell of 6th level or lower.</li>\n<li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.</li>\n<li>Potentially undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as <em>feeblemind </em>or <em>insanity</em>, that require miracle to counteract. To attempt to undo such a spell, the exalted must make a caster level check using her level in the spellcasting class to which she added her exalted levels (including the increases in spellcasting from her exalted levels) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the targeted effect. On a success, the exalted counters the spell or effect. On a failure, the exalted does not counter the spell or effect, though she can try again after 24 hours.</li>\n<li>Make a request of her chosen deity in line with the above effects. Doing so requires a sacrifice of 10,000 gp in powdered diamond or another appropriate precious material based on the teachings of the deity&rsquo;s faith. Examples of potential effects include returning a fallen ally to life and full health, teleporting the exalted and her allies to a location with no chance of error, or protecting a town from a wildf ire. In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity&rsquo;s nature is refused.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are calculated as if it were a 7th-level spell. When an exalted uses this ability to duplicate a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, she must provide that component.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.L5qbnFbFvCfhzRU0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Vitality (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.elAcoLowBH97mKiP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Scholar (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4inISy7G5Ngd7S64","dataType":"compendium","name":"Religious Speaker (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":4,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.7lNjp5l5lRqM0DPh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Perform Miracle (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":10,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tSqiiiJKKXU3jmOK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Obedience (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lOYalHX4eZ75GDHo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Expanded Portfolio (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5bxt9Gboc6Yr18ET","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Brand (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fHgUQLVlOYI4MKjr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Boon","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":3,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ESmEnSFVwQBCV6e7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aspect of Divinity (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":7,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lRmf8xptuEyiZ8o5","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ardent Vision (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_03.jpg","level":8,"_index":9}]},"tag":"exalted","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"chosen deity’s favored weapon"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

This damage is positive energy damage if the target is undead, or negative energy damage if the target is living; creatures that are neither living nor dead, such as constructs, are unaffected by this ability. <br /><br /><strong>Vital Strike</strong>: At 1st level, a mortal usher gains the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vital%20Strike\">Vital Strike</a> feat, and at 6th level he gains the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Improved%20Vital%20Strike\">Improved Vital Strike</a> feat, even if he would not normally meet the prerequisites for them. If the mortal usher already has Vital Strike or Improved Vital Strike when he would gain it through this ability, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he first took it. For the purposes of qualifying for any feat that includes Vital Strike as a prerequisite, the mortal usher can use his class level in place of his base attack bonus, adding this value to his base attack bonus from any other classes he has as normal. <br /><br /><strong>Mortal Talents</strong>: At 2nd level, a mortal usher must choose a class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the mortal usher gains the class features of an additional level in his chosen class (for example, a <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wizard\">wizard</a> 5/mortal usher 4 would have the arcane bond benefits, caster level, and spells per day of a 7th-level wizard). He still retains the Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks of the prestige class, but gains all other class features of his chosen class at the specified levels. <br /><br /><strong>Nosoi Plague Mask (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a mortal usher can conjure or dismiss a <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Nosoi\">nosoi</a> plague mask as a free action. This plague mask is a physical manifestation of the mortal usher&rsquo;s soul and cannot be destroyed or stolen, though its magic can be suppressed by an <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=antimagic%20field\"><em>antimagic field</em></a> or similar effect. As long as the mortal usher&rsquo;s nosoi plague mask is conjured, the mortal usher gains the ability to cast <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=invisibility\"><em>invisibility</em></a> on himself as a standard action with a caster level equal to 5 + his class level.<br /><br />In addition, the mortal usher can activate the nosoi plague mask as a standard action, forcing all living and undead creatures within a 60-foot radius to attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + the mortal usher&rsquo;s class level). Those that fail are fascinated; this effect continues for every round the mortal usher maintains the effect as a swift action and for 1 round thereafter. The mortal usher cannot use the <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=invisibility\"><em>invisibility</em></a> effect of the plague mask while using its fascinate ability, and a creature that saves against the fascination effect is immune for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect; it can affect undead even though they would normally be immune to mind-affecting effects. <br /><br /><strong>Catrina&rsquo;s Calm (Su)</strong> At 5th level, a mortal usher emits a 30-foot-radius aura that acts as a <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=calm%20emotions\"><em>calm emotions</em></a> spell on creatures within its area, with a DC of 16 + the mortal usher&rsquo;s class level. Creatures are entitled to a new saving throw each time they reenter the area of the aura after leaving it, and a creature who successfully saves against the aura&rsquo;s effects is immune to it for 24 hours. The mortal usher can suppress or resume this aura as a swift action. <br /><br /><strong>Morrigna Wrappings (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a mortal usher gains the ability to designate any cloak, scarf, robe, or shirt in his possession as his wrappings, granting it unique powers in addition to any abilities or enchantments it may already have. The wrappings grant the mortal usher a natural armor bonus equal to half his class level as long as it is in his possession, and they can be used as a magic whip that can be wielded even if the mortal usher&rsquo;s hands are full. When used as a whip, the wrappings gain an enhancement bonus equal to the mortal usher&rsquo;s class level. These bonuses can be added to the whip to increase its enhancement bonus to a maximum of +5 (minimum +1), or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Brilliant%20Energy\"><em>brilliant energy</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Disruption\"><em>disruption</em></a> (this supersedes the normal requirement that a <em>disruption</em> weapon must be a bludgeoning weapon), <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flaming\"><em>flaming</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flaming%20Burst\"><em>flaming burst</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Frost\"><em>frost</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Holy\"><em>holy</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Icy%20Burst\"><em>icy burst</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shock\"><em>shock</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shocking%20Burst\"><em>shocking burst</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Unholy\"><em>unholy</em></a>, or <a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vorpal\"><em>vorpal</em></a>. Adding these properties reduces the enhancement bonus granted by this ability by an amount equal to the property&rsquo;s cost.

Some are most at home treading ground untouched in years or even centuries, in search of the next challenge, the next dungeon, or the next ancient treasure. Pathfinder delvers prefer to leave the journaling to others and set off on a new grand adventure before the ink dries on the chronicles of their last. Often they&rsquo;re accompanied by a cohort or other companion who might not have the bravery (or foolhardiness) to go it alone on a grand adventure, but is more than willing to chronicle the exploits and adventures of another. For many in the Pathfinder Society, the delvers represent a frustrating combination&mdash;on the one hand, their eagerness to explore helps the Society reach areas and learn secrets that may otherwise go undiscovered. On the other hand, their tendency toward poor documentation worries many Society members, who fear that the bulk of what a delver might discover will go unreported.<br /><br />Pathfinder delvers run the gamut from dedicated archaeologists to thrill-seeking adventurers to unprincipled tomb robbers. Their choice of companionship is similarly varied; some travel with other Pathfinders, some take up with any who will join their quests, and some go it alone. Nearly all share a love of knowledge and history, though, and would go to great lengths to preserve a historic find that is at risk of being destroyed or lost forever.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Pathfinder delver, a character must fulfill the following criteria. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Acrobatics 5 ranks, Disable Device 4 ranks, Knowledge (history) 4 ranks, Perception 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: Must have recovered an object of historical significance from an ancient ruin or similar historic location. The nature of this object can vary, but it must be presented to a Pathfinder Lodge and be verified by an agent there. The object need not be handed over to the Society&mdash; in most cases, these objects are ancient magical items discovered in the course of adventuring and remain in the possession of the Pathfinder delver.

Levels in this class stack with levels in any other class that grants bardic knowledge or a similar ability.<br /><br /><strong> Master Explorer (Ex)</strong>: A Pathfinder delver adds half his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Disable Device and Perception checks. A Pathfinder delver can disable intricate and complex traps in half the normal amount of time (minimum 1 round) and open a lock as a standard action instead of a full-round action. He can always take 10 on Disable Device and Stealth checks, even if distracted or endangered, and he can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.<br /><br /><strong> Surefooted (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Pathfinder delver can move through difficult terrain at his normal speed. Ground that has been magically manipulated to impede motion still affects him normally.<br /><br /><strong> Trap Sense (Ex)</strong>: This ability functions as (and stacks with) the rogue class feature of the same name, save that a Pathfinder delver gains the bonuses at 2nd level and they increase every 3 levels thereafter.<br /><br /><strong> Thrilling Escape (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Pathfinder delver can attempt to delay a trap immediately after triggering it. To use this ability, he attempts a Disable Device check as an immediate action against the trap&rsquo;s Disable Device DC; if he&rsquo;s successful, the trap&rsquo;s activation is delayed until the end of his next turn. The Pathfinder delver can attempt this check even if the trap was triggered by a failed Disable Device check. The Pathfinder delver can do this once per day at 3rd level, twice per day at 7th level, and three times per day at 9th level.<br /><br /><strong> Guardbreaker (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Pathfinder delver&rsquo;s familiarity with the strange guardians often left in tombs allows him to attack them more effectively. He can treat his trap sense bonus as if it were a favored enemy bonus against constructs, oozes, and undead; this bonus stacks with any favored enemy bonuses gained from ranger levels or similar class features.<br /><br /><strong> Resourceful Disabler (Ex)</strong>: Pathfinder delvers are adept at making use of what&rsquo;s at hand. At 4th level, a Pathfinder delver can use the Disable Device skill without tools at no penalty.<br /><br /><strong> Vigilant Combatant (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a Pathfinder delver adds half his class level on initiative checks.<br /><br /><strong> Left for Dead (Su)</strong>: At 5th-level, a Pathfinder delver can cheat death once per day. If he would be killed by a melee attack, ranged attack, or effect that requires a saving throw, he is instead reduced to &ndash;1 hit points and knocked unconscious, but is stable. He appears dead (though a character who succeeds at a DC 25 Heal check or who uses an ability such as deathwatch can tell he is not) for 1 minute, after which he regains 1 hp and becomes conscious (unless healed sooner).<br /><br /><strong> Fortunate Soul (Su)</strong>: Once per day at 6th level, the Pathfinder delver can reroll any saving throw he has just attempted. He must choose to use this ability before the results are revealed and must take the second result even if it&rsquo;s worse. He can use this ability twice per day at 10th level.<br /><br /><strong> True Seeing (Sp)</strong>: At 9th level, a Pathfinder delver can use <em>true seeing</em> once per day (CL = his class level).<br /><br /><strong> Nick of Time (Ex)</strong>: Once per day at 10th level, a Pathfinder delver can use an immediate action to perform an action that normally requires a standard action to perform.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.iCSQ5FZ5vNepN0gF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bardic Knowledge (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.D3cOrYVj6GvV0CLw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master Explorer (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oLWashkj6Mcm74Bs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Surefooted (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.HoV8PmENaujyGx7T","dataType":"compendium","name":"Trap Sense (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.I1C3ZQg1rgRA0APs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Thrilling Escape (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mSVqDtxp5tjScjEV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Guardbreaker (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.N0KsMS1VazzWKLh2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Resourceful Disabler (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":4,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.E6lG1oEIBQJmgyED","dataType":"compendium","name":"Vigilant Combatant (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":4,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aFjH32hrPZOl54kZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Left for Dead (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":5,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.GROcVbwp5IUuSTWn","dataType":"compendium","name":"Fortunate Soul (Su)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":6,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Qn02lvcjmlewbQmN","dataType":"compendium","name":"True Seeing (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":9,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4AxgZVIX1gANmzDV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Nick of Time (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/navigation/sextant-brass-brown.webp","level":10,"_index":11}]},"tag":"pathfinderDelver","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":8,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Among the freedom fighters, wardens have proven themselves again and again, taking on enemies that threaten the fate of Nirmathas. With their unmatched martial prowess and tactical skills, Chernasardo wardens are masters of the forest. They specialize in neutralizing enemies without being seen, but they are not a threat to be taken lightly even in close-quarters combat.<br /><br />This title is earned only by those who have overcome insurmountable odds and survived unimaginable danger. There are just a handful of wardens alive at any given time, as it is a position that places one in constant peril. Wardens set themselves apart by wearing crests or armor fashioned from trophies won in battle. Traditionally, these were made from the horns or hide of great beasts of the Fangwood, but in recent years, regalia of high-ranking Molthuni officials has become more common. Only the Nirmathi forest marshal commands more respect than a warden among the Chernasardo Rangers.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Chernasardo warden, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any nonevil and nonlawful.<br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Stealth 5 ranks, Survival 5 ranks.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: You must defeat an evil enemy of a CR 5 levels higher than your character level.

At 3rd level, she can use the following tactics in combat. She can gain the bonus of only a single tactic at a time, but can switch between them as a swift action. If the Chernasardo warden becomes confused, frightened, panicked, or shaken, she cannot gain any bonuses from guerrilla tactics for as long as the condition persists.<br /><br /><em>Exploit Weakness</em>: When flanking an enemy, a Chernasardo warden can forgo the +2 bonus on attack rolls from flanking until the start of her next turn in order to further punish the foe. On a successful hit against a flanked enemy while forgoing the attack bonus, the Chernasardo warden can perform a disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver against the target as a swift action at her full base attack bonus. This action still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.<br /><br /><em>Sneak Attack</em>: A Chernasardo warden gains sneak attack +1d6. This increases to +2d6 at 6th level and +3d6 at 9th level.<br /><br /><em>Sniping Prowess</em>: The Chernasardo warden takes advantage of any available cover. Her penalty on Stealth checks to snipe changes to &ndash;16. The penalty changes to &ndash;12 at 6th level and &ndash;8 at 9th level.<br /><br /><em>Sprite Step</em>: When moving through wooded terrain, the Chernasardo warden gains a +4 competence bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks. While climbing, she does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC and does not take a penalty for climbing quickly.<br /><br /><strong>Advanced Tactics (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a Chernasardo warden adds the following tactics to her list of choices.<br /><br /><em>Preemptive Strike</em>: The Chernasardo warden strikes before her targets can react. When acting during a surprise round, she can take one move action and one standard action. She cannot take a full-round action during a surprise round, as normal.<br /><br /><em>Trick Shot</em>: This tactic allows the Chernasardo warden to attempt Dirty Trick combat maneuver checks with a ranged weapon at a &ndash;4 penalty. At 9th level, this penalty changes to &ndash;2.<br /><br /><strong>Second Tactic (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a Chernasardo warden is able to benefit from two tactics at a time. She can change one of these at a time as a swift action.<br /><br /><strong>Phantom Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a Chernasardo warden becomes a true master of the battlefield. She can always move at her full speed across nonmagical difficult terrain and does not take movement penalties due to poor visibility.<br /><br />A number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier, when the Chernasardo warden deals weapon damage to an opponent who is unaware of her presence, she can deal an additional 2d6 points of precision damage or cause the target to cower for 2d6 rounds. The target receives a Will saving throw to negate the cowering effect (DC = 10 + half the Chernasardo warden&rsquo;s character level + her Intelligence modifier).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rm3Fp5N9av1lLxfK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Advanced Tactics (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","level":6,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qeR5t81CcK5plxBA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Feats","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TS28vPv25FKna7Dw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Forest Magic (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QkceRDLMpXqRJ5AQ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Guerrilla Tactics (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9uivowmU43JcW1tH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Phantom Strike (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","level":10,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1ES6kFa0LN4Cyfy1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Second Tactic (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","level":9,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MhoQkCMW7CP09Mhe","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unchained Heart (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Bd03S70l5emCY7aG","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aligned Class (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_13.jpg","level":2,"_index":7}]},"tag":"chernasardoWarden","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt"],"custom":"Bucklers"},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":true,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Chernasardo Warden","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Despite the name of the class, any arcane spellcaster can expand her powers via this prestige class, not only arcanists. Most Magaambyan arcanists consider their studies to be a sacred duty and a tradition that spans the ages. As a Magaambyan arcanist learns the deeper meanings locked within the academy&rsquo;s wisdom, she discovers the true enlightened and philanthropic purpose of the Magaambya.<br /><br />Perhaps the most unusual facet of the Magaambyan arcanists&rsquo; magical techniques is their method of interpreting and using magic of a druidic nature as arcane power. This unusual combination allows the Magaambyan arcanist incredible versatility in her studies, for the secrets of druidic magic are normally beyond the ken of arcane spellcasters. Yet the Magaambyan arcanist does not merely copy the magic of the natural world&mdash;she expands upon it. She simultaneously respects the traditions from which this magic stems while exploring it in ways that druids, who view their magic as a result of their faith, rarely consider. This method of converting druidic spells to arcane spells is taxing to the mind, however, and since each Magaambyan arcanist must create her own such translations, the school has not made arcane versions of druidic spells available to all arcane spellcasters. In fact, most students of the Magaambya are opposed to such an endeavor, for as intrigued as they are by this magic, they respect its traditions and do not wish to see these secrets made freely available to those who may not share their respect.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Magaambyan arcanist, a character must fulfill the following

radiates an aura of good as if she were a cleric of a level equal to her class level (see the <em>detect good</em> spell).<br /><br /><strong> Halcyon Magic (Su)</strong>: At each class level, a Magaambyan arcanist chooses a spell from the druid spell list and treats it as if it were on the spell list of one of her arcane spellcasting classes. A Magaambyan arcanist must choose a druid spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can currently cast. The spell&rsquo;s type becomes arcane and its save DC functions as normal for the arcane spellcasting class list she adds it to. The Magaambyan arcanist automatically learns this spell, adding it to her spellbook or familiar as appropriate for the class of the spell list to which she added the spell.<br /><br /><strong> Superior Spell Mastery (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, by spending a total of 24 hours studying over a maximum of 3 days, a Magaambyan arcanist can change the spells she has mastered with the Spell Mastery feat. She can choose a number of spells she knows up to her Intelligence modifier (which can have a maximum combined spell level equal to or less than her caster level) to be her Spell Mastery spells in place of the same number of spells she previously selected for her Spell Mastery feat.<br /><br /><strong> Virtuous Spells (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Magaambyan arcanist casts spells with the good descriptor at +1 caster level. To prepare a spell with the evil descriptor, she must use two spell slots of that spell level.<br /><br /><strong> Intoned Recollection (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, by performing a special ritual lasting 1 minute, a Magaambyan arcanist can prepare a spell into an open arcane spell slot. The open spell slot must have purposefully been left empty at the beginning of the day when the Magaambyan arcanist prepared her spells. She must be able to read her spellbook or have mastered the spell with the Spell Mastery feat to prepare it with this ability. She doesn&rsquo;t need to rest for 8 hours beforehand, but all other requirements of the preparation process still apply. At 9th level, she can do this as a full-round action, provided she has her spellbook in hand or has mastered the spell with the Spell Mastery feat. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier.<br /><br /><strong> Lasting Goodness (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, all of a Magaambyan arcanist&rsquo;s spells with the good descriptor have their durations extended by a number of rounds equal to her class level. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent isn&rsquo;t affected by this ability.<br /><br /><strong> Spontaneous Spell Mastery (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a Magaambyan arcanist can lose any prepared spell to cast a spell of the same spell level or lower that she has mastered with the Spell Mastery feat. She can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 8th level.<br /><br /><strong> Blessed Warding (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, a Magaambyan arcanist is under a constant <em>protection from evil</em> effect (CL equal to her class level). If this effect is dispelled, she can reactivate it as a swift action.<br /><br /><strong> Immediate Spell Mastery (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, once per day, a Magaambyan arcanist can cast any spell she has mastered with the Spell Mastery feat, even if she hasn&rsquo;t prepared it that day. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the Magaambyan arcanist, but can&rsquo;t be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.<br /><br /><strong> Righteous Contravention (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a Magaambyan arcanist gains a +2 bonus on checks to overcome the spell resistance of evil creatures or evil objects, and on checks to dispel spells cast by evil creatures, spells with the evil descriptor, or evil magic items.<br /><br /><strong> Holy Arcana (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a Magaambyan arcanist expands her skill at translating divine magic into arcane spells. She adds all the bonus spells from the Good cleric domain to the spell list of one of her arcane spellcasting classes. These spells&rsquo; type becomes arcane and the save DCs function as normal for the arcane spellcasting class list she adds them to.<br /><br /><strong> Altruistic Guardian (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, once per day when a spell or supernatural effect that allows spell resistance targets a Magaambyan arcanist&rsquo;s allies or if they are within its area of effect, as an immediate action she can redirect the effects to herself. She can do this for a number of allies up to her Intelligence modifier, provided they are within 30 feet of her. The Magaambyan arcanist must attempt the appropriate saving throws for each ally, possibly attempting multiple saving throws against the same spell or effect. She takes all damage and suffers all conditions and other effects that her allies would have taken, possibly taking these multiple times. This protects allies only from damage and conditions they&rsquo;d take at the time she spends the immediate action, not from any they might later suffer from a noninstantaneous spell or effect.<br /><br /><strong> Timeless Body (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a Magaambyan arcanist no longer takes penalties for aging. This functions exactly like the druid ability of the same name.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1gjCsX6yiP4vV6eC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Altruistic Guardian (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":10,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.g7dOocadCrEgbO2F","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aura of Good (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hHKdMIDQe6Sxb4mT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blessed Warding (Sp)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pgzWRyEFgjMmGHeR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Halcyon Magic (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wbpZGlafOCpaLS3m","dataType":"compendium","name":"Holy Arcana (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":9,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mKjkyUOwjU00vwSt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Immediate Spell Mastery (Sp)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":6,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.y20pzrzm7hDwvwUt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Intoned Recollection (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.HQSJqAuGMUFB0Lyv","dataType":"compendium","name":"Lasting Goodness (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":3,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.iOYvcmxnuOA5h5H8","dataType":"compendium","name":"Righteous Contravention (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":7,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.DaeYUsTsutpYMwIu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spontaneous Spell Mastery (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":4,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.C8eRVgcQeXy2QiBK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Superior Spell Mastery (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":2,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1QAyvkvu1svUPTSi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Timeless Body (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":10,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ptj8fsunJerZutyJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Virtuous Spells (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-backed-wood-tan.webp","level":2,"_index":12}]},"tag":"magaambyanArcanist","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Not as stuffy or restrictive as a fullfledged knighthood, in their hearts chevaliers are just good people who want to celebrate the good things in life and fight evil wherever it dares to tread.<br /><br />Chevaliers welcome all like-minded folk regardless of religion, though most of them worship Cayden Cailean. Most are fighters, rogues, or barbarians, but sorcerers, clerics, and bards are not unheard of. Chevaliers often wear golden pins noting their patron liege or deity or the token of a lover or other for whom they fight. Membership is easily obtained by swearing an oath in the presence of another chevalier and invoking the name of who they fight for or the figure that embodies their desire to do good in the world. An adventurer-turned- innkeeper in a frontier town, a band of travelers looking for bandits, and a would-be dragonslayer might all be chevaliers.

In some regions, it is a faith that seeks little more than the succor and relief of suffering wherever it can be found, a warming and cleansing flame that banishes chill, darkness, and despair. Elsewhere, Sarenrae&rsquo;s faith is a flame that not only cleanses but scourges the wicked, seeing injustice and cruelty as a wound that must be cauterized. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a faith built upon such incandescent passion and verve, the servants of Sarenrae don&rsquo;t always agree on the best methods to carry out their goddess&rsquo;s will, and their disagreements become heated, often to the point of violent conflict.<br /><br />Dawnflower dissidents arise to deal with schism and heresy within their own faith, seeking either to expunge or heal the divisions that plague their religion. In order to avoid identification by hostile eyes, Dawnflower dissidents must constantly work in secret, and eschew holy symbols for more discreet shows of faith, such as tattoos or wellhidden pieces

Dawnflower dissident prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A Dawnflower dissident gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Deception (Ex)</strong>: A Dawnflower dissident adds a sacred bonus equal to 1/2 his level on Bluff or Sense Motive checks to send, interpret, or intercept coded messages, and increases the DC of Spellcraft checks made to identify his spells by the same amount. He also adds the following spells to his spell list: <em>illusion of calm</em><sup>UC</sup> (1st), <em>rope trick</em> (2nd), <em>nondetection </em>(3rd), <em>detect scrying</em> (4th), <em>mage&rsquo;s private sanctum </em>(5th), <em>veil</em> (6th), <em>mage&rsquo;s magnificent mansion</em> (7th), <em>screen </em>(8th), and <em>communal mind blank</em><sup>UC</sup> (9th). In addition, the duration of these spells doubles when they target worshipers of Sarenrae (including the caster). This does not affect the level of the spell or its casting time, and does not stack with feats or effects such as Extend Spell.<br /><br /><strong>Eschew Materials</strong>: A Dawnflower dissident gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat, and he can ignore any divine focus (holy symbol) components for his spells.<br /><br /><strong>Secret Caster (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Dawnflower dissident can disguise his spellcasting with a Bluff check (for spells with verbal components), opposed by the observer&rsquo;s Sense Motive check, and/or a Sleight of Hand check (for spells with somatic components), opposed by the observer&rsquo;s Perception check. Depending on the situation, the Dawnflower dissident&rsquo;s Bluff and/ or Sleight of Hand check is modified according to the following table.<br /><br /></p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Penalty</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Condition</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-0</td>\n<td>Spell has a range of personal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-5</td>\n<td>During combat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-5</td>\n<td>Spell has a range of touch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-10</td>\n<td>Spell has a range longer than touch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-Spell level &times;2</td>\n<td>Spell has a visible, audible, or otherwise observable effect</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Automatic failure</td>\n<td>Spell has an observable effect that clearly emanates from the caster</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />Casting a spell in this fashion increases its casting time to a full-round action (if normally a standard action or less), or doubles the casting time of spells with a casting time longer than a full-round action. A spell cast in this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity from observers that fail to recognize it for what it is. For spells with both verbal and somatic components, the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity from observers unless they fail both their Sense Motive and Perception checks.<br /><br /><strong>Schismatic Apostle (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Dawnflower dissident adds a +1 bonus to the DC of mind-affecting effects used against followers of both Sarenrae and Rovagug. If he is an inquisitor, any bonuses he gains from his judgment increase by 1 when used against followers of Sarenrae or Rovagug.<br /><br /><strong>Burning Blade (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a Dawnflower dissident can expend one use of channel energy as a swift action to grant a scimitar he touches the <em>flaming </em>weapon special ability for 1 round per 1d6 points of damage the channeled energy would normally heal. If a worshiper of Sarenrae wields the scimitar and strikes another worshiper of Sarenrae, as a free action the wielder may choose to make all damage from the attack nonlethal, as if wielding a weapon with the <em>merciful </em>weapon special ability. An inquisitor may instead choose to expend one use of his judgment ability to imbue the scimitar with the <em>flaming </em>weapon special ability for a number of rounds equal to his caster level, or may use this ability in place of his bane ability.<br /><br />At 8th level, this power grants the touched scimitar the <em>flaming burst</em> weapon special ability instead.<br /><br /><strong>Shift Blame (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, when a Dawnflower dissident provokes an attack of opportunity, he can attempt to deceive the creature making the attack of opportunity into believing the provoking action was performed by another creature as long as it is adjacent to the Dawnflower dissident and also threatened by the attacker. Doing so requires a Bluff check opposed by the attacker&rsquo;s Sense Motive check. The attacker gains a bonus equal to its base attack bonus on this Sense Motive check. If the Bluff check is successful, the attack of opportunity instead targets an adjacent creature chosen by the Dawnflower dissident, and the attacker must reroll her attack roll to see whether she hits this new target.<br /><br /><strong>Morning Light (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, a Dawnflower dissident can spend a full-round action reciting the litany of Sarenrae&rsquo;s renewing wisdom while expending two uses of channel energy or one use of his judgment ability. This grants each ally within 15 feet of him a new saving throw against any one ongoing condition or effect that allows a save. This does not affect instantaneous or permanent effects or effects that do not allow a saving throw. Allies that worship Sarenrae (including the Dawnflower dissident) can instead attempt a new saving throw against every ongoing condition or effect that allows a save.<br /><br /><strong>Flight of the Phoenix (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, when a Dawnflower dissident is killed his body is engulfed in a column of holy fire equivalent to a <em>flame strike </em>at his caster level. At the beginning of his next turn, his spirit returns in the form of a phoenix (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </em>227) that fights as he directs for up to 1 minute and then disappears. This phoenix is not considered called or summoned. The Dawnflower dissident is reborn (as <em>resurrection</em>) 1d4 rounds after it disappears in a random location within 1 mile, with his gear intact but with two permanent negative levels. If the phoenix is killed before it disappears, the Dawnflower dissident cannot be reborn via this ability, though other methods of raising him still work.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MEbgc7ZeWSi87LOP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Deception (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/lily-white.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Q0n0y23oKgESSiIh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eschew Materials","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/lily-white.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.g8s6lKtK9UOf6h73","dataType":"compendium","name":"Secret Caster (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/lily-white.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.VNAS2B13lmCeQgwK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Schismatic Apostle (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/lily-white.webp","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LxW1dP6YO5oGQNcs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Burning Blade (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/lily-white.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.0AEkxSEpgQwEN7Td","dataType":"compendium","name":"Shift Blame (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/lily-white.webp","level":6,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wAzgbrlj5Gs5ZGEB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Morning Light (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/lily-white.webp","level":9,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.dyCs8GSLIiDsWnz8","dataType":"compendium","name":"Flight of the Phoenix (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/flowers/lily-white.webp","level":10,"_index":7}]},"tag":"dawnflowerDissident","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They serve as faceless enforcers of order and use their magical powers to relentlessly root out and punish criminals to the letter of the law. They wear masks&mdash; often featureless&mdash;to mark themselves as impersonal agents of order, unswayed by empathy, detached from emotion, and dedicated to passing impartial judgment upon all lawbreakers. A signifer&rsquo;s distinctive mask is a symbol of his devotion to the precepts of law and exacting justice, and it serves as the focus for several of his signifer powers. Traditionally, signifers are arcane or divine spellcasters. As a signifer must be lawful, clerics who take this prestige class generally worship lawful deities, with the majority being worshipers of Abadar or Asmodeus. Despite trends toward diabolism, overall a signifer&rsquo;s views of good and evil are defined by his Hellknight order first and everything else second. While it&rsquo;s certainly possible for a psychic spellcaster to become a Hellknight signifer, to date, such examples are relatively rare among the various Hellknight orders. Yet in time, as such magic spreads and gains acceptance, psychic Hellknight signifers may well grow more common.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Hellknight signifer, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong> Alignment</strong>: Any lawful.<br /><strong> Armor Proficiency</strong>: Proficient with medium armor. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Arcane Armor Training or Warrior Priest<sup>UM</sup>. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Intimidate 2 ranks, Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Spells</strong>: Able to cast 3rd-level spells. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: The character must slay a devil with Hit Dice greater than his character level.

This doesn&rsquo;t grant any new powers or abilities. In addition, a Hellknight signifer with the Warrior Priest feat gains Alignment Channel (chaos) as a bonus feat, and treats his Hellknight signifer levels as cleric levels when determining the amount of damage healed or dealt and saving throw DCs of his channeled energy.<br /><br /><strong> Order</strong>: A Hellknight signifer chooses a Hellknight order to join at 1st level. The most common Hellknight orders (and their favored weapon or weapons) are: Chain (flail), Gate (dagger), Godclaw (morningstar), Nail (halberd or lance), Pyre (glaive), Rack (longsword or whip), and Scourge (heavy mace or whip).<br /><br /><strong> Signifer Mask (Su)</strong>: Upon initiation, a Hellknight signifer receives a mask, often devoid of eyeholes or other personal features. This mask doesn&rsquo;t obscure the Hellknight signifer&rsquo;s vision, and while wearing it he gains a +2 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks and on saving throws against spells and abilities that rely on visual effects.<br /><br />A Hellknight signifer with a bonded object from the arcane bond class feature can perform a special ritual that costs 500 gp and takes 8 hours to complete. This ritual converts the Hellknight signifer&rsquo;s mask into his new bonded object, which takes up the head slot. In this case, his Hellknight signifer levels stack with levels from the class that grants the arcane bond for determining what additional magical abilities can be added to the bonded object.<br /><br /><strong> Arcane Armor Expertise (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, if a Hellknight signifer has the Arcane Armor Training feat, he gains Arcane Armor Mastery as a bonus feat. At 5th level, the action required to use this feat changes from a swift action to a free action.<br /><br /><strong> Signifer Armor Training (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, while a Hellknight signifer wears Hellknight armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0), and reduces the arcane spell failure chance by 5%. At 8th level, he reduces his armor check penalty by an additional 1, and reduces his arcane spell failure by an additional 5%. Additionally, at 8th level, when a Hellknight signifer&rsquo;s speed is reduced by wearing medium or heavy armor, his unique training decreases the speed reduction by 5 feet.<br /><br /><strong> Assiduous Gaze</strong>: At 4th level and again at 7th level, a Hellknight signifer gains an assiduous gaze ability chosen from the list below. A Hellknight signifer can use each assiduous gaze ability he has for a number of rounds per day equal to half his class level. These rounds need not be consecutive. A Hellknight signifer can activate an assiduous gaze ability as a swift action to examine a single creature, object, or 5-foot square within 30 feet. A Hellknight signifer must be wearing his signifer mask to use these abilities, and his caster level while using the ability is equal to his character level.<br /><br /><em> Elucidation (Su)</em>: The Hellknight signifer can discern each active spell on the target, including the spell&rsquo;s effect and caster level.<br /><br /><em> Morality (Sp)</em>: The Hellknight signifer can determine whether the target is chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, as well as the strength of its aura as if he had studied it for 3 rounds using <em>detect chaos</em>, <em>detect evil</em>, <em>detect good</em>, and <em>detect law</em>.<br /><br /><em> Scrutiny (Su)</em>: The Hellknight signifer can discern whether the target has spell-like abilities or spellcasting abilities; whether any spellcasting abilities are arcane, divine, or psychic; and the strength (see <em>detect magic</em>) of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the target currently has available.<br /><br /><em> Veracity (Sp)</em>: The Hellknight signifer can observe the target as if using <em>true seeing</em>. A Hellknight signifer must be 7th level to select this ability.<br /><br /><em> Vigilance (Su)</em>: The Hellknight signifer can see through up to 5 feet of stone, wood, or similar barriers as if they didn&rsquo;t exist. This effect cannot penetrate metal of any kind.<br /><br /><strong> Discern Lies (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, a Hellknight signifer can use <em>discern lies</em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. His caster level is equal to his total character level.<br /><br /><strong> Infernal Resilience (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a Hellknight signifer gains DR 5/chaotic and becomes immune to poison.<br /><br /><strong> Diabolic Harbinger (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, as long as a Hellknight signifer wears his signifer mask, he gains telepathy with a range of 100 feet and can see perfectly in both magical and mundane darkness. While wearing his signifer mask, he is immune to blindness and dazzling effects, and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based checks when interacting with lawful creatures. This bonus increases to +4 if the creature is also an outsider.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qHQGOU6O8Xkv50SW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Arcane Armor Expertise (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vLBLeepb4eyERA8G","dataType":"compendium","name":"Assiduous Gaze","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":4,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WANaLNAg6UHTsKja","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aura of Law (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.P06mzx8uRRWjhGZw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Catechesis (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.UyFmxdJKtmiqs2Oc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Diabolic Harbinger (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":10,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AXci9ACyCugALXQq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Discern Lies (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":6,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4ZFilGsRjE9AUT2n","dataType":"compendium","name":"Infernal Resilience (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":9,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.x98eJtpZOKK4A4Wj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Signifer Armor Training (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":3,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.v5euWGtNKvsdk1eq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Signifer Mask (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/inventory/badge-sun.jpg","level":1,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.l9kcurxNGEcqdty0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Order","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/hellknight-plate.png","level":1,"_index":9}]},"tag":"hellknightSignifer","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["hvy"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"One of his order’s favored weapons"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Among the followers of Torag, some feel drawn to devote themselves to these later aspects of the Father of Creation. Known as sacred sentinels, these holy warriors view themselves as mortal shields of defense in Torag&rsquo;s service, and seek to place themselves where defenders are most needed. Many speak of themselves as pillars, strong structures that can hold up a vast building but only by supporting the other beams and supports needed. The pillar is the source of the strength, but its strength must serve to support a network of other beams or it accomplishes little. <br /><br />Sacred sentinels are always front-line combatants, and value mobility to ensure they can reach the places they are most needed. As a result they are most often cavaliers (especially of the order of the dragon, the order of the guard from <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Combat</em>, or the order of the shield) or paladins with a mount as a divine bond. The majority of sacred sentinels are dwarves, but other races that worship Torag are sometimes called to serve. For example, in the frozen Lands of the Linnorm Kings, there exists a relatively obscure but long-standing order known as the &ldquo;Linnorm Guard.&rdquo; This small number of Ulfen fighters are unusually lawful in their outlook, considering the brutality and chaos their barbaric kin often embrace. The Linnorm Guard seeks to provide protection for both the Linnorm Kings and those they have allied with, be they visiting dignitaries, old but beloved boon companions, or even hidden lovers or paramours.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a sacred sentinel, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +6. <br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Lawful good. <br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Must worship Torag. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Endurance, Toughness. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: Proficiency with light, medium, and heavy armor and all shields (other than tower shields).</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Sacred Sentinel's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Code of Torag, stragetic protection (+3/30 feet)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Renewed bonds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Healing touch (3d8), tempering touch +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Strategic protection (+4/40 feet),</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Uncanny dodge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Healing touch (4d8), tempering touch +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Stragetic protection (+5/50 feet)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Swift shield other</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Healing touch (5d8), tempering touch +3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.879%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.9274%;\">Strategic protection (+6/60 feet), unyielding</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are the class features of the sacred sentinel prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Code of Torag (Su)</strong>: A sacred sentinel has dedicated her life to serving as a protective shield of Torag, and this is her first and highest calling. Though not all sacred sentinels are paladins, they all must follow the paladin&rsquo;s code of Torag (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 150</em>). Cavaliers who become sacred sentinels are given special dispensation by their cavalier orders to act as agents of Torag within their orders, and treat Torag&rsquo;s paladin code of conduct as their cavalier&rsquo;s edict (replacing the normal edicts for their orders).<br /><br />A sacred sentinel who violates this code loses all class features of this prestige class other than skill points and class skills for 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong>Strategic Protection (Su)</strong>: As a move action, a sacred sentinel can establish a magic aura that protects one or more of her allies. When she establishes her aura, she selects a number of allies up to her Charisma bonus that she can see and that are within 20 feet. As long as these allies remain within 30 feet of the sacred sentinel, they gain a +3 bonus to their CMDs and on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying. The bonus increases to +4 at 4th level, to +5 at 7th level, and to +6 at 10th level. The radius of this aura increases by 10 feet at each of these levels. The bonuses from strategic protection last until the beginning of the sacred sentinel&rsquo;s next turn.<br /><br /><strong>Renewed Bonds (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a sacred sentinel is able to maintain strong bonds from her life before becoming a divine guardian. If the sacred sentinel has levels in a class with an animal companion, familiar, or a class feature with &ldquo;bond&rdquo; in the name (such as arcane bond, divine bond, or sacred bond), she selects one such class upon gaining her 1st level of sacred sentinel. Sacred sentinel levels stack with levels in the selected class when determining the effectiveness of her familiar, animal companion, or bond class feature. Whenever the sacred sentinel uses strategic protection, her familiar, animal companion, or bonded companion is automatically included in its protection if in range, without counting toward the maximum number of creatures the sacred sentinel can affect.<br /><br />A sacred sentinel without an appropriate class feature from another class instead increases the number of creatures she can protect with her bastion of protection by 1 upon gaining this class feature, and by another 1 at 6th level.<br /><br />If the sacred sentinel has cavalier, paladin, or warpriest class levels, she selects one of those classes and adds half her sacred sentinel level to those class levels to determine her effective class level for a specific class feature. For cavaliers, this determines the effectiveness of her challenge class feature. For paladins, this determines the effectiveness of her smite evil class feature. For warpriests, this determines how many times per day she can use her blessings.<br /><br /><strong>Healing Touch (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a sacred sentinel can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by her touch. Each day, she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + 1/2 her sacred sentinel level. If she has established her strategic protection, she can use this ability on a selected ally within range of the aura without having to successfully touch the ally. This ability restores 3d8 hit points, increasing to 4d8 at 6th level, and 5d8 at 9th level. Healing touch qualifies as the lay on hands ability for the purpose of prerequisites requiring lay on hands, and abilities that work with lay on hands (such as mercies).<br /><br /><strong>Tempering Touch (Su)</strong>: A sacred sentinel knows that the best way to defend allies is to temper them to be stronger. At 3rd level, when a sacred sentinel uses a spell or class feature (but not a magic item or the Heal skill) to heal an ally, the ally gains a defensive bonus. For a number of rounds equal to the sacred sentinel&rsquo;s class level, whenever the ally fights defensively, uses the full defense action, or uses Combat Expertise, the ally gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws. These bonuses increase to +2 at 6th level and to +3 at 9th level.<br /><br /><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a sacred sentinel gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She gains uncanny dodge, as per the rogue class feature. If the character gains uncanny dodge from another class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (as per the rogue talent).<br /><br /><strong>Swift Shield Other (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, a sacred sentinel can use <em>shield other</em> as a quickened spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum once per day).<br /><br /><strong>Unyielding (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a sacred sentinel&rsquo;s devotion to protecting those under her charge is great enough to temporarily hold off death.

While most traditional spellcasters consider these occult rituals dangerous and unreliable, some spellcasters hone their skills with such rituals, making the strange spells more likely to succeed and less likely to cause unintended harm. As ritualists deepen their understanding of ritual magic, they broaden their understanding of all things occult, becoming true masters of mysteries which others have no ability to comprehend. Even those uninitiated in the art of magic can cast rituals and interact with the fabric of magic, but their rituals pale in comparison to the power of those who have sacrificed, specialized, studied, and trained to perfect such arts.<br /><br />Becoming a ritualist requires a vast amount of knowledge, time, and training. Those who take up the calling of ritualist are typically high-ranking members of esoteric orders, though their pursuits often lead them down paths that even their peers versed in the occult shy away from. By seeking and honing such dangerous magic, ritualists regularly risk death&mdash;or worse. If a ritualist reaches the height of her power before losing sight of her soul or becoming lost in the dark voids between worlds, she becomes a force beyond reckoning, able to learn and perform powerful rituals at alarming speeds.<br /><br />Ritualists who repeatedly put their peers in grave danger rarely last long as members of organized groups, often becoming outcasts. These outcast ritualists are typically some combination of fatalistic, obsessive, and unpredictable in their search for occult power.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a ritualist, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (arcana or history) 8 ranks. <br /><strong>Spells</strong>: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: The character must be a member of a group that regularly deals with the occult, such as the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye or the Night Heralds.

She does not, however, gain any other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character has more than one spellcasting class, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Esoteric Discovery (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, 3rd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, a ritualist selects one skill. When using that skill to cast an occult ritual, the ritualist can take 10 on the skill check, but only once per skill during any given ritual. <br /><br /><strong>Student of Mysteries (Ex)</strong>: A ritualist adds half her ritualist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on Intelligence checks made to learn new occult rituals. <br /><br /><strong>Stabilize Ritual (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, once per day as a full-round action, a ritualist can refocus a ritual that has been paused, removing any increases to the ritual&rsquo;s skill check DCs that have accrued thus far due to pausing the ritual. <br /><br /><strong>Occult Expertise (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a ritualist adds half her class level as a bonus on all skill checks when using occult skill unlocks. Additionally, a ritualist can take 10 on skill checks when using occult skill unlocks with skills chosen with the esoteric discovery ability. <br /><br /><strong>Cautious Rituals (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, once per day when beginning to cast a ritual as the primary caster, a ritualist can decide to cast the ritual as a cautious ritual. The DCs of a cautious ritual&rsquo;s skill checks increase by half the ritual&rsquo;s level (rounded down, minimum 1). However, if the ritual fails, there is a cumulative 10% chance per ritualist level (40% at 4th level, 50% at 5th level, and so on) that the ritual causes none of its usual failure or backlash effects. The ritual still causes backlash if it succeeds.<br /><br />At 6th level, the ritualist&rsquo;s successful cautious rituals do not cause any backlash to any of their secondary casters.<br /><br />At 8th level, a ritualist can cast a cautious ritual without increasing the ritual&rsquo;s skill check DCs. <br /><br /><strong>Expedited Rituals (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, once per day when beginning to cast a ritual as the primary caster, a ritualist can decide to cast the ritual as an expedited ritual. The DCs of an expedited ritual&rsquo;s skill checks increase by half the ritual&rsquo;s level (rounded down). However, the ritualist can cast the ritual as soon as its casters succeed at the requisite number of skill checks rather than waiting for the ritual&rsquo;s full casting time to elapse. A ritual can be both cautious and expedited, but the penalties stack.<br /><br />At 9th level, a ritualist can cast an expedited ritual without increasing the ritual&rsquo;s skill check DCs. <br /><br /><strong>Independent Rituals (Su)</strong>: At 7th-level, a ritualist becomes so adept at casting rituals that secondary casters are unnecessary. Once per day when beginning to cast a ritual as the primary caster, the ritualist can decide to cast the ritual as an independent ritual. The ritualist gains a bonus on all skill checks attempted as part of casting the ritual equal to half the ritualist&rsquo;s level, and she can always take 10 when using skills she chose for her esoteric discovery ability. However, none of the ritual&rsquo;s secondary casters, if any, can attempt any of the ritual&rsquo;s skill checks. The ritualist can still include secondary casters as part of a ritual, if it allows secondary casters, to grant them the ritual&rsquo;s effects.<br /><br />An independent ritual can also be cast as an expedited or cautious ritual (or both). <br /><br /><strong>Focused Rituals (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a ritualist can maintain a ritual&rsquo;s focus even under dire circumstances. While performing a ritual as the primary caster, the ritualist can continue the ritual even if some or all of its secondary casters are incapacitated, killed, or moved out of range of the ritual. <br /><br /><strong>Master of Mysteries (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a ritualist&rsquo;s knowledge of the occult reaches unfathomable depths, and she can perform rituals with disturbing alacrity. Once per day when casting a ritual as the primary caster, the ritualist can reduce the casting time from 10 minutes per ritual level to 1 round per ritual level, or from 1 hour per ritual level to 1 minute per ritual level. One of the ritual&rsquo;s casters attempts a check every round or every minute of the casting instead of every 10 minutes or every hour, as appropriate</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1xTrhaubiNTk4SJJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Esoteric Discovery (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Y1LZmoF3BpLMgUey","dataType":"compendium","name":"Student of Mysteries (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aIOPV6DyYP3h7pi7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Stabilize Ritual (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fo5nSfrQZ82biFe9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Occult Expertise (Ex)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tIoU1UHn6WV4pmg9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Cautious Rituals (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cSnA0wsOC3PU1m8n","dataType":"compendium","name":"Expedited Rituals (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pHJV0PqXTuZpwcVB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Independent Rituals (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":7,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gunGZWKgXSRusGyP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Focused Rituals (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":8,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.7zxYOiud8r6FRCQT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master of Mysteries (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-triangle-silver-purple.webp","level":10,"_index":8}]},"tag":"ritualist","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Those who must face eldritch knights in combat fear them greatly, for their versatility on the battlefield is tremendous; against heavily armed and armored opponents they may level crippling spells, while opposing spellcasters meet their ends on an eldritch knight's blade. <br /><br />Because the road to becoming an eldritch knight requires both martial prowess and arcane power, eldritch knights almost always begin their paths as multiclassed characters, such as fighter/wizards or ranger/sorcerers. They may be found wherever studies of the arcane are as prevalent as martial training. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Eldritch knights blend the abilities of fighting classes and spellcasters, hurling magic at the enemy one moment and hewing down their opponents with steel the next. They are just as comfortable fighting in the thick of combat as they are casting spells at foes while remaining safely behind their compatriots. Their versatility makes them valuable allies when the nature of an upcoming battle is unclear. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: The road to becoming an eldritch knight is as varied as the paths leading to apprenticeship under a wizard or a career as a soldier, and eldritch knights can therefore be of any alignment. Maintaining a balance between studies of arcane lore and martial techniques requires great discipline, however, and for that reason many favor lawful alignments.</span></p>\n<h2

/><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Eldritch knights gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: At 1st level, an eldritch knight may choose a bonus combat feat. This is in addition to the feats that a character of any class normally gets from advancing levels. The character must still meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats. An eldritch knight gains an additional combat feat at 5th and 9th level. <br /><br /><strong>Diverse Training</strong>: An eldritch knight adds his level to any levels of fighter he might have for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats (if he has no fighter levels, treat his eldritch knight levels as levels of fighter). He also adds his level to any levels in an arcane spellcasting class for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats. <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, an eldritch knight gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an eldritch knight, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Spell Critical (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, whenever an eldritch knight successfully confirms a critical hit, he can cast a spell as a swift action. The spell must include the target of the attack as one of its targets or in its area of effect. Casting this spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The caster must still meet all of the spell's components and must roll for arcane spell failure if necessary.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TRhmS32s08pVVL1P","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Feat","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-red-3.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.JgS79cltO2roEIhv","dataType":"compendium","name":"Diverse Training","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-red-3.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fBRnu3avpUtDEBWg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spell Critical (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-red-3.jpg","level":10,"_index":2}]},"tag":"eldritchKnight","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They are respected in some ways for their depth of knowledge about the history of the region, yet some people find them dangerously stubborn in their pursuit of secrets best left lost and in their borderline obsession with any scraps or fragments of rubble with markings that even remotely resemble runes. Like the legendary Cyphergate itself (an enormous rune-carved arch that spans the entrance to Riddleport&rsquo;s harbor), much of the labor of the Cyphermages seems to others to be wasted on pondering and searching for hidden meanings and sublime significance that simply may not exist. Nonetheless, Cyphermages are dogged in their pursuit of knowledge, often secretive not only with outsiders but also with one another, as each strives to uncover a forgotten scrap of lore, unearth a choice bit of Thassilonian architecture, or present a triumphant dissertation to his Cyphermage peers or to academics half a world away.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Cyphermage, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Cypher Magic&dagger;, Scribe Scroll. <br /><strong>Languages</strong>: Know two languages associated with Thassilon or Varisia (such as the ancient language of Thassilonian, regional languages like Varisian or Shoanti, or ancient languages like Aklo, Draconic, or Giant). <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Knowledge (history) 5 ranks, Linguistics 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Spells</strong>: Able to cast arcane spells.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Cyphermage's class skills are Appraise (Int), Climb (Str), Disable Device (Dex), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Use Magic Device (Cha).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d6.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Special</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells Per Day</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>Cypher lore</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>Cypherlord</td>\n<td>+1 level of arcane spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Cyphermage prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Cypher Lore</strong>: As a Cyphermage gains levels, he begins mastering written magic such as scrolls, glyphs, and symbols. He also begins to discover ancient Thassilonian magics that further bolster his power. These discoveries are known collectively as cypher lore. At each level except for 10th, the Cyphermage learns a new way to enhance his magic, chosen from the list of cypher lore discoveries below.<br /><br /><em> Analyze Scroll (Su)</em>: As a free action, the Cyphermage can automatically discern the contents of a magic scroll, as if he were using read magic. He gains an insight bonus equal to his Cyphermage level on Use Magic Device checks to cast spells from scrolls.<br /><br /><em> Bypass Symbol (Su)</em>: When the Cyphermage attempts a saving throw against a magical glyph, symbol, sigil, or similar written trap, as an immediate action he can attempt a Spellcraft check against the same DC to delay the trap&rsquo;s effects for 1d6 rounds. Once the delay is over, the trap has its normal effect. The Cyphermage must be at least 8th level to select this lore.<br /><br /><em> Defensive Scrollcaster (Ex)</em>: The Cyphermage gains a +4 bonus on concentration checks to cast spells defensively when casting spells from scrolls.<br /><br /><em> Enhance Scroll (Su)</em>: As a swift action, the Cyphermage can cause any scroll spell he reads to function using his caster level rather than the scroll&rsquo;s caster level. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-third his Cyphermage level (minimum 1).<br /><br /><em> Extended Scroll (Su)</em>: As a swift action, the Cyphermage can double the duration of any spell he reads from a scroll as if the spell were modified by Extend Spell. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-third his Cyphermage level (minimum 1).<br /><br /><em> Focused Scroll (Su)</em>: As a swift action, the Cyphermage can add a bonus equal to twice his Intelligence modifier on any caster level checks attempted when activating a scroll spell, including checks to overcome spell resistance. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-third his Cyphermage level (minimum 1).<br /><br /><em> Giant&rsquo;s Master (Ex)</em>: The Cyphermage has unraveled several of Thassilon&rsquo;s methods of commanding and controlling giants. As a swift action whenever he uses a mind-affecting spell or effect on a humanoid with the giant subtype, he increases the DCs of spells he casts by 2. The Cyphermage must be at least 6th level to select this lore.<br /><br /><em> Glyph Finder (Ex)</em>: The Cyphermage can locate <em>glyphs of warding</em>, symbol spells, and similar magical spell traps that use writing as if he were a rogue. He can use Perception or Knowledge (arcana) to notice such traps, and can use Disable Device or Spellcraft to disable these types of traps.<br /><br /><em> Insightful Scroll (Su)</em>: As a swift action, the Cyphermage can alter a spell he&rsquo;s casting from a scroll to use his own spellcasting ability score (for example, Intelligence for wizards) and relevant feats to set the save DC for the spell. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-third his Cyphermage level (minimum 1).<br /><br /><em> Rune Trap (Ex)</em>: Whenever the Cyphermage casts a spell that creates a trap that uses magical writing (such as <em>explosive runes, illusory script, sepia snake sigil</em>, or a symbol spell), as a swift action he can include Thassilonian runes in the writing. This increases the Perception DCs to notice it, Disable Device DCs to disarm it, and caster level DCs to dispel it by 4. The Cyphermage must be at least 6th level to select this lore.<br /><br /><em> Swift Scrivener (Ex)</em>: The Cyphermage can scribe up to two scrolls per day, so long as the total market price of all scrolls scribed that day does not exceed 1,000 gp. The Cyphermage reduces the casting time of all symbol spells to 1 minute.<br /><br /><em> Swift Scroll (Ex)</em>: The Cyphermage does not provoke attacks of opportunity when retrieving a stored scroll. If the Cyphermage moves at least 10 feet, he can retrieve a scroll as a free action combined with his movement.<br /><br /><em> Thassilonian Focus (Ex)</em>: The Cyphermage chooses one of the seven schools of Thassilonian magic, as detailed on page 63 (if the Cyphermage is a Thassilonian specialist [see page 63], he must choose the same school of magic for his Thassilonian focus as he chose for his specialization). He gains a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities from that school of magic.<br /><br /><em> Thassilonian Incantation (Su)</em>: The Cyphermage has discovered a way to empower language-dependent spells when speaking Thassilonian. When he does so, the save DCs of the spells increase by 1, but those targeted by such a spell&rsquo;s effects must still be able to understand Thassilonian to be affected by it. If the Cyphermage also has the rune trap cypher lore, the Cyphermage can include Thassilonian runes in any spell he casts that creates magical writing (such as a symbol or <em>explosive runes</em>). Doing so doubles the spell&rsquo;s casting time, but causes the spell effect to manifest at +1 caster level.<br /><br /><em> Thassilonian Summoning (Ex)</em>: The Cyphermage has learned how to summon strange creatures to his aid when he casts certain <em>summon monster</em> spells. He adds sinspawn (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</em> 246) to the list of monsters he can conjure with <em>summon monster III</em>, lamias to the list of monsters he can conjure with <em>summon monster VI</em>, and shining children (<em>Bestiary 2</em> 245) to the list of monsters he can conjure with <em>summon monster IX</em>. The Cyphermage must be at least 6th level to select this lore.<br /><br /><strong> Cypherlord (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Cyphermage gains a +5 insight bonus on saving throws against the effects of magical symbols, glyphs, sigils, and similar writing-based spells and traps. He selects one of his cypher lore abilities that requires a swift action to activate; thereafter, he can activate that ability as a free action.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.GLOiOEA87imlBmxT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Cypher Lore","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-symbol-circle-gold-red.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Lv1PWQrPMCb6prvi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Cypherlord (Su)","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-symbol-circle-gold-red.webp","level":10,"_index":1}]},"tag":"cyphermage","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":true,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Cyphermage","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

/>The following are class features of the prophet of Kalistrade prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A prophet of Kalistrade gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Spells</strong>: A prophet of Kalistrade casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, but is limited to divination and enchantment spells. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To cast a spell, a prophet of Kalistrade must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. His bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + the spell level + the caster&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (if any). His selection of spells is extremely limited&mdash;at each prophet of Kalistrade level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on the table on page 43. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, he can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows, provided the new spell is of the same level as the one he is replacing.<br /><br />As he gains levels, a small number of additional spells are added to the prophet of Kalistrade&rsquo;s spell list. He does not automatically learn these spells when they become available&mdash; they must be selected as part of his total spells known. At 2nd level, he adds <em>divine favor </em>and <em>f loating disk </em>to his spell list. At 4th level, he adds <em>augury </em>and <em>zone of truth </em>to his spell list. At 6th level, he adds <em>arcane lock</em> and<em> make whole </em>to his spell list. At 8th level, he adds <em>glibness </em>and <em>obscure object </em>to his spell list. At 10th level, he adds <em>discern lies </em>and <em>divination </em>to his spell list.<br /><br /><strong>Auspicious Display (Ex)</strong>: A prophet of Kalistrade projects an air of confidence and inviolability by displaying his wealth and status. So long as the prophet wears 1,000 gp worth of purely decorative jewelry, clothing, or other adornments, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. This bonus (and the necessary value of his accoutrements) increases as he gains levels, to +2 for 4,000 gp at 4th level, +3 for 9,000 gp at 7th level, and +4 for 16,000 gp at 10th level.<br /><br /><strong>Purchase Spells (Su)</strong>: Starting at 2nd level, a prophet of Kalistrade can cast spells not normally available to him by expending a certain amount of gold. A prophet of Kalistrade can spontaneously cast any 1st-level spell he knows&mdash;even if he has expended all of his spells for that day&mdash;by sacrificing 500 gp worth of currency (gp, sp, and so on) or gems. If the spell has a material component cost, it is added to the base cost of this ability. Currency or gems used in this way must be on the prophet&rsquo;s person, and goods other than standard currency or precious gems cannot be sacrificed to use this ability. Casting a spell in this way does not expend any of the prophet&rsquo;s uses of spells for that day, and once sacrificed, the currency spent to use this ability cannot be retrieved in any way&mdash;the money has effectively disappeared forever.<br /><br />At 4th level, the prophet of Kalistrade can cast a 2ndlevel spell he knows by sacrificing 1,500 gp. At 7th level, he can cast a 3rd-level spell by sacrificing 3,000 gp. At 10th level, he can cast a 4th-level spell by sacrificing 5,000 gp.<br /><br /><strong>Business Acumen (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a prophet of Kalistrade can treat settlements as one size category larger when determining their base values and purchase limits. At 7th level, this ability improves so that the prophet can treat settlements as two size categories larger. At 10th level, the prophet can treat settlements as four size categories larger.<br /><br /><strong>Mystical Contacts (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, once per week a prophet of Kalistrade can call in favors from his trading partners to purchase a spellcasting service at half its normal price. The prophet must still find a spellcaster capable of casting the spell he desires (which usually means finding a large enough settlement), and must provide any expensive material components required by the spell at their full price.<br /><br /><strong>Prophet&rsquo;s Chest (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, a prophet of Kalistrade can hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane, as per the spell secret chest, except that the prophet does not need an expensive chest or replica&mdash;any chest will do. The prophet can summon the chest back to the Material Plane as a standard action up to three times per day. So long as the prophet accesses the chest once every month, it suffers no chance of being lost on the Ethereal Plane. A prophet of Kalistrade can have only one chest on the Ethereal Plane in this way.<br /><br /><strong>Planar Contacts (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, a prophet of Kalistrade can purchase an outsider&rsquo;s services for half the normal cost when he casts a <em>planar ally </em>spell or is within 30 feet of an ally who casts a <em>planar ally </em>spell. When negotiating with a creature called by a <em>planar binding </em>spell (either his own or an ally&rsquo;s), the prophet gains a +4 bonus on any opposed Charisma checks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ex-Prophets of Kalistrade</h2>\n<p>A prophet who ceases to be lawful neutral, or who violates the dietary and sexual prohibitions set forth in the Prophecies of Kalistrade, loses all class features (except weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies), and cannot progress further in levels as a prophet of Kalistrade. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his violations (see the atonement spell description), as appropriate.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eOfQ8noTHhx9nGI2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Auspicious Display (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_10.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WQMJaiAPZjZ8ytBg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Purchase Spells (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_10.jpg","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YJVE31Ks5yS5ycPr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Business Acumen (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_10.jpg","level":4,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.G4q9MGLPQIjoWu09","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mystical Contacts (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_10.jpg","level":6,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.P74hkVg2dTzB7RbT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Prophet's Chest (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_10.jpg","level":8,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.D23ZMeJOnnwYT53k","dataType":"compendium","name":"Planar Contacts (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_10.jpg","level":9,"_index":5}]},"tag":"prophetOfKalistrade","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The creature takes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls and to AC, and a &ndash;2 penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1); its base damage increases by one size category; and its reach increases to 10 feet. It also gains a +2 size bonus to its Strength and Constitution. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the Strength bonus increases by an additional 2; the bonus to Constitution increases by an additional 2 at 5th and again at 9th level.<br /><br /><strong> Steed (Ex)</strong>: A mammoth rider can choose from among the following animal companions to serve as her loyal steed: amargasaurus<sup>B6</sup>, arsinoitherium<sup>B2</sup>, aurochs, baluchitherium<sup>B3</sup>, brontotherium<sup>B6</sup>, camel<sup>B2</sup>, cat (big), deinotherium<sup>B6</sup>, dire polar bear<sup>B5</sup>, elasmotherium<sup>B6</sup>, elk<sup>B3</sup>, horse, kentrosaurus<sup>B6</sup>, mastodon, megaloceros<sup>B2</sup>, moa<sup>B5</sup>, rhinoceros, styracosaurus<sup>B4</sup>, triceratops, uintatherium<sup>B5</sup>, wolf, woolly mammoth (use the statistics for a mastodon), or woolly rhinoceros. A GM might expand this list to include other possible steeds. This steed functions as a druid&rsquo;s animal companion, replacing any animal companion or mount gained from another class. The mammoth rider&rsquo;s class levels stack with other classes that grant an animal companion to determine her effective druid level.<br /><br /><strong> Wild Coercion (Ex)</strong>: A mammoth rider gains the wild empathy ability; this functions exactly like the druid ability of the same name. For the purposes of this ability, her class level stacks with all other classes that have the wild empathy ability. In addition, a mammoth rider can use her wild empathy to demoralize an animal or magical beast, or force it to be friendly to her, as if using Intimidate rather than Diplomacy. She adds her Strength modifier to these checks in addition to her Charisma modifier.<br /><br /><strong> Born Survivor (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level and again at 6th level, a mammoth rider gains a bonus feat from the following list: Great Fortitude, Improved Great Fortitude, Improved Iron Will, Improved Lightning Reflexes, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes. She must meet the prerequisites for these feats.<br /><br /><strong> Colossus Hunter (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a mammoth rider gains a +1 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against Large and Huge creatures, and a +2 bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against Gargantuan and Colossal creatures.<br /><br /><strong> Rapid Straddle (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a mammoth rider can attempt Ride checks to fast mount or fast dismount her steed even if it&rsquo;s more than one size category larger than her, provided she still has a move action available that round.<br /><br /><strong> Rugged Steed (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the natural armor bonus of a mammoth rider&rsquo;s steed increases by 1.<br /><br /><strong> Mistrust of Magic (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, as long as a mammoth rider doesn&rsquo;t have levels in a class that grants arcane spellcasting ability, she gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against arcane spells. If she has no levels in classes granting divine spellcasting ability, she gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against divine spells. If she has no levels in classes granting psychic spellcasting ability, she gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against psychic spells.<br /><br /><strong> Undaunted (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a mammoth rider adds her Strength bonus to the DC of Intimidate checks attempted against her. Additionally, creatures attempting to intimidate a mammoth rider don&rsquo;t gain a bonus for being larger than her.<br /><br /><strong> Valiant Devotion (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a mammoth rider&rsquo;s steed gains a +4 morale bonus against charm, compulsion, and fear effects.<br /><br /><strong> Hunter&rsquo;s Instinct (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a mammoth rider gains the quarry class feature; this functions exactly like the ranger ability of the same name. If she already has the quarry class feature from another class, she instead gains the improved quarry class feature. A mammoth rider can use these abilities on any creature, not just a favored enemy.<br /><br /><strong> Steed&rsquo;s Reach (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a mammoth rider&rsquo;s steed&rsquo;s reach improves to 15 feet.<br /><br /><strong> Combined Might (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, a mounted mammoth rider strikes with the combined power of herself and her steed. Once per round, when the mammoth rider hits with a melee attack from astride her steed during a charge, she adds half her steed&rsquo;s Strength bonus to the damage roll in addition to her own, provided her steed is currently capable of taking a free action.<br /><br /><strong> Pulverizing Assault (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, if a mammoth rider is mounted on her steed and directs it to charge or make a constrict, powerful charge, or trample attack, then the first time that her steed deals damage with that attack this round, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the steed&rsquo;s Hit Dice + the steed&rsquo;s Strength modifier) or be staggered for 1d4 rounds.<br /><br /><strong> Mammoth Lord (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a mammoth rider becomes immune to the dazed, fatigued, shaken, sickened, staggered, and stunned conditions. If she succeeds at a Fortitude or Will save against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. If a mammoth rider and her steed both hit an opponent on the same turn, the foe must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the steed&rsquo;s Hit Dice + the steed&rsquo;s Strength modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. Whether or not the target succeeds, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours thereafter.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cSwACtNteggALtv0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Born Survivor (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mDLVSAfxmo0KekY0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Colossus Hunter (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6LCBif7gth4UEOJs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Combined Might (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":8,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6L4ShtncIU6yBXOw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Gigantic Steed (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sOUZUIIVJLEp6o9i","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hunter's Instinct (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":6,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vmUNL8lgUkWoHidB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mammoth Lord (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":10,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.bNMKUlTvjAs7m4VC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mistrust of Magic (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":4,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2CxYu4en3QVPx0R7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Pulverizing Assault (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":9,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.svfvNQL4u1FbRuUp","dataType":"compendium","name":"Rapid Straddle (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":3,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.jrnwcg2jsgmSMtMj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Rugged Steed (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":3,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kCGdhd3HFfjP8tFC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Steed (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IVdkkRdFXXQHtaJs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Steed's Reach (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":7,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rTgeElkRhxafnNGq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Undaunted (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":4,"_index":12},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KQXe3ofgN2gcIZUs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Valiant Devotion (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":5,"_index":13},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zLQtGvEsdz5YmwLX","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wild Coercion (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/bones/hooves-cloven-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":14}]},"tag":"mammothRider","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":12,"hp":12,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

choose alchemist as the class to enhance with this ability, increasing her alchemist extracts per day.<br /><br /><strong>Distilled Spells (Su)</strong>: A brewkeeper can spend 1 minute distilling an extract or spell she has prepared or an unused spell slot into a draught. When she does so with an alchemist extract, the draught functions as if enhanced by the infusion discovery. Spells can be distilled only if they qualify to be created as a potion or oil from the spell but without the limitation of being a 3rd- or lower-level spell. Once a draught is created, it persists for up to 24 hours, even if it is no longer in the brewkeeper&rsquo;s possession. After this point, the draught becomes inert and the brewkeeper regains the use of that extract or spell slot (although she must still prepare that slot normally, as if she had cast the spell or used the extract from that slot during the day). As long as the draught remains potent, it continues to occupy one of the brewkeeper&rsquo;s daily extract or spell slots. A draught functions as a potion or oil, and can be used by any creature.<br /><br /><strong>Faithful Drinker (Ex)</strong>: When a brewkeeper drinks a potion, elixir, mutagen, draught, or other magical beverage, the brewkeeper gains a +2 sacred bonus on Will saves for 1 round.<br /><br /><strong>Brew Reservoir (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a brewkeeper gains a reservoir of brew points that she can use to apply helpful or harmful homebrews to her draughts, extracts, and spells. A brewkeeper can add only one such effect to a single draught, extract, or spell at a time. The number of points in a brew reservoir is equal to 3 + her brewkeeper level. The brew reservoir is replenished whenever the brewkeeper prepares her spells or extracts.<br /><br /><strong>Helpful Homebrew (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level and every 2 class levels thereafter, a brewkeeper can select one metamagic feat from the list in the following paragraph. She can spend points from her brew reservoir as a swift action to add a metamagic effect to a spell as she casts it, an extract as she drinks it, or a draught as she creates it. She does not need to meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites in order to select the effect. Using this ability costs a number of brew points equal to the metamagic feat&rsquo;s level increase (minimum 1).<br /><br />The metamagic effects available (and the brewkeeper level at which she can select them) are: Empower Spell (4th), Extend Spell (2nd), Fleeting Spell<sup>UIOA</sup> (4th), Maximize Spell (6th), Silent Spell (4th), and Tenacious Spell<sup>UI</sup> (2nd).<br /><br /><strong>Harmful Homebrew (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a brewkeeper can enhance her attacks with a harmful homebrew. Whenever she hits a creature with a splash weapon or a touch spell, she can spend 1 brew point as a swift action to add an effect to the spell or splash weapon. These additional effects caused by a harmful homebrew apply regardless of whether or not the target succeeds at any saving throws associated with the touch spell or splash weapon&rsquo;s normal affects. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to avoid the effect of the harmful homebrew (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brewkeeper&rsquo;s caster level + the brewkeeper&rsquo;s highest mental ability score modifier). On a successful save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round (as if suffering, temporarily, the effects of intoxication), but on a failed save, the target is aff licted with the harmful homebrew&rsquo;s effect, as chosen by the brewkeeper from the options below. Conditions inf licted by hindering homebrews don&rsquo;t stack.<br /><br />At 3rd level, the brewkeeper can select one of the following effects when she successfully affects a creature with a harmful homebrew. Every 3 class levels thereafter, the brewkeeper can apply an additional harmful homebrew effect to her touch spell or splash weapon, for a total of three effects at 9th level.<br /><br /><em>Entangled</em>: The target becomes entangled in its gear until it spends a full-round action adjusting itself. <br /><br /><em>Fatigued</em>: The target is fatigued for 1 round. <br /><br /><em>Prone</em>: The target falls prone. <br /><br />At 6th level, the brewkeeper adds the following harmful homebrews to the list of those she can select. <br /><br /><em>Confused</em>: The target is confused for 1 round. <br /><br /><em>Dazed</em>: The target is dazed for 1 round. <br /><br /><em>Staggered</em>: The target is staggered for 1 round. <br /><br />At 9th level, the brewkeeper adds the following homebrews to the list of those she can select. <em>Exhausted</em>: The target is exhausted for 1 round, and then fatigued for 1 round after that. The brewkeeper must have applied the fatigued condition to the harmful homebrew before selecting this effect. <br /><br /><em>Nauseated</em>: The target is nauseated for 1 round. <br /><br /><strong>Potion Master (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a brewkeeper can, as a move action, add a chaser of alcohol when she drinks a potion or administers a potion to a willing creature. If she does so, she uses her own caster level instead of the potion&rsquo;s caster level when determining the effects of the potion. She can also apply the effects of a helpful homebrew to a potion at this time as if it were a draught she had created.<br /><br /><strong>Brew Specialization (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a brewkeeper can apply the effects of two helpful homebrews or harmful homebrews instead of one when she takes a swift action to apply a homebrew&rsquo;s effect. She must still pay the full brew point cost for the homebrews she applies.<br /><br /><strong>Quick Brewing (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a brewkeeper can create a draught as a full-round action.<br /><br /><strong>True Brewkeeper (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a brewkeeper can create a draught as part of a spell&rsquo;s normal casting time or as part of the action to draw an extract, effectively allowing her to spontaneously create draughts. In addition, she can apply up to three homebrew effects at once. When the brewkeeper uses her faithful drinker ability, the sacred bonus granted applies to all saving throws for 1 round.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TzOylYpgFvvOM7gc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Brew Reservoir (Su)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Dzu3omgJFMj5kHIN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Brew Specialization (Su)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":5,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6ysXgHuylxQFl4LN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Distilled Spells (Su)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rupiddOu3aueETSl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Faithful Drinker (Ex)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qColoEkMxeguQbKA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Harmful Homebrew (Su)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.skGdNJjDauUUpGKd","dataType":"compendium","name":"Helpful Homebrew (Su)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2Ou3EDSd9g0CHqwO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Potion Master (Ex)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.HgZyISF0vxRXTDCA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Quick Brewing (Su)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":7,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9FYmnM3swWUWMBLe","dataType":"compendium","name":"True Brewkeeper (Su)","img":"icons/containers/kitchenware/stein-empty.webp","level":10,"_index":8}]},"tag":"brewkeeper","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Brewkeeper","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Spherewalkers explore extreme locales, dream fantastic dreams, and press their luck (good and bad) to make their lives interesting and noteworthy. They are known for founding cities, discovering lost civilizations, and going places where none have ever trod. They may choose to walk the distant paths alone or try to understand the mysteries of the mind and soul and become great leaders. Above all, spherewalkers seek adventure, with all the risks and rewards that such endeavors bring.<br /><br />Spherewalkers are often multiclassed characters, as they tend to dabble in various classes to suit their adventuring needs. Their versatility adds extra depth and utility to combat-oriented characters (barbarians, fighters, rangers), their unusual magic appeals to spellcasters, and their special abilities make it easy for nonmagical characters to get out of tight spots.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a spherewalker, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria:<br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Desna.<br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: 5 ranks in any two of the following skills: Climb, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (religion), Perform, Ride, Survival, or Swim.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Martial Weapon Proficentcy (starknife), one survivor feat (Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or Lightning Reflexes), one explorer feat (Acrobatic, Agile, Athletic, Endurance, Run, or Self-Sufficient).<br /><strong>Special</strong>: A spherewalker-to-be must have journeyed far in his lifetime, visiting two locations sacred to Desna that are at least 200 miles apart.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Spherewalker's class skills are Balance, Climb, Concentration, Escape Artist, Handle Animal, Heal, Jump, Knowledge (geography), Perform, Ride, Spot, Survival, Swim, and Tumble.<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8184%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.7672%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.257%;\"><strong>Spells Per Day</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8184%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.7672%;\">Landmark, longstrider</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.257%;\">+1 level of spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8184%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.7672%;\">Efficient sleep, star slinger</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.257%;\">+1 level of spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8184%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.7672%;\">Dream link</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.257%;\">+1 level of spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8184%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.7672%;\">Divine luck</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.257%;\">+1 level of spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.45903%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8184%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.7672%;\">Swarm form</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.257%;\">+1 level of spellcasting class</td>\n</tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the spherewalker prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Landmark (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, as a full-round action a spherewalker can create a mental landmark for her current location and thereafter take a standard action to note the general direction of that landmark. For example, if she sets her landmark in Magnimar and later travels to Korvosa, she can determine that Magnimar is roughly west of her current location. The landmark doesn&rsquo;t have to be a city or any kind of recognizable site&mdash;it could be in the middle of the ocean or even midair. This is a scrying effect. A landmark location is one category more familiar for the purpose of teleporting (&ldquo;studied carefully&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;very familiar&rdquo; and so on). A spherewalker can have one landmark per class level. She can discard an existing landmark as a standard action and does not need to be at that location to discard it. Spherewalkers can take a minute to share a landmark with another spherewalker, and often do so to arrange meetings in unusual places without the need for maps or directions. A spherewalker can only detect the location of landmarks on her current plane, though they do not vanish if she leaves the plane and she can reference them if she returns to that plane.<br /><br /><strong>Longstrider (Sp)</strong>: At 1st level, a spherewalker may use <em>longstrider</em> once per day. Her caster level is equal to her character level.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: When a spherewalker gains a level, she gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of spherewalker to the level of whatever other spellcasting class she has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.<br /><br />If the character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a spherewalker, she must choose which class she adds each spherewalker level to for the purpose of determining spells per day.<br /><br />If the spherewalker has no levels in a spellcasting class, she instead gains one 1st-level domain spell slot, which she may use to prepare spells from any of Desna&rsquo;s domains as if she were a cleric. Her caster level is equal to twice her class level. With each new spherewalker level, she gains a new spell slot for a spell level equal to her class level. A 5th-level spherewalker would thus have a spell slot for one domain spell from 1st to 5th level spells. The number of bonus spells and spell save DCs are set by the spherewalker&rsquo;s Wisdom score.<br /><br /><strong>Efficient Sleep (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a spherewalker gains a +4 sacred bonus to resist sleep effects and only needs 4 hours of sleep (or restful calm, for creatures that do not need actual sleep) instead of the normal 8 hours to become rested. Most spherewalkers prefer to sleep the normal amount, and if they use this ability they like to make up for it on later days by sleeping late.<br /><br /><strong>Star Slinger (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, any starknife a spherewalker uses in combat is treated as if it had the returning magic weapon special ability. Such weapons gain no additional enhancement bonuses or magical properties beyond this effect.<br /><br /><strong>Dream Link (Sp)</strong>: A 3rd-level spherewalker can form a mental bond with another willing intelligent creature as if using the <em>telepathic bond</em> spell. To do so, she and the target must spend at least 4 hours sleeping within 10 feet of each other. Either person in the link can end it as a standard action; otherwise it is permanent. If one person in the link dies, the other is stunned for 1 round and staggered until she can rest for 10 minutes. A spherewalker can only maintain one such link at a time, though she may be the recipient of multiple links. Married spherewalkers often link themselves to their spouses.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Luck (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a spherewalker can add a luck bonus equal to her class level on an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1/day). She may add this bonus after she has rolled but before she knows if the unmodified result is a success or failure.<br /><br /><strong>Swarm Form (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a spherewalker gains the ability to transform into a swarm of Diminutive butterflies. In swarm form, she has a space of 10 feet (roughly filling the entire area) but can shape this space to fill four contiguous squares (such as a 5-foot-by- 20-foot line, an L-shaped cloud, and so on) and can squeeze through any space large enough to contain one of her component forms. The swarm can fly at a speed of 40 feet (good). Like any swarm, it can occupy the same space as another creature regardless of its size.<br /><br />Any creature that begins its turn sharing a space with a swarm must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spherewalker level + Constitution bonus) or be nauseated for 1 round. Unlike most swarms, a spherewalker in swarm form does not do swarm damage to creatures she&rsquo;s swarming over. The swarm form is immune to weapon damage but is vulnerable to mundane fire attacks (torches, alchemical fire, burning oil, and so on), and energy attacks from weapon (such as flaming and frost) deal full damage even though the basic weapon damage has no effect. Although a swarm cannot make attacks, the spherewalker can cast spells as normal while in swarm form (although spells with material components could prove difficult).<br /><br />A spherewalker can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her class level and remain in this form for up to one minute. While in swarm form, she may expend one use of this ability as a free action in order to remain in swarm form for an additional minute (rather than changing back to her normal form and activating it again). Changing back to her natural form before the effect ends is a standard action.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.su4BFzxn5pSyDFLt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Luck (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/statue-hound-horned.webp","level":4,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lzwZGyJnFzvlHXAT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dream Link (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/statue-hound-horned.webp","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.JHMjcL8WElA3MopJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Efficient Sleep (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/statue-hound-horned.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.y60Fl30OTdBQmf41","dataType":"compendium","name":"Landmark (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/statue-hound-horned.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wlfWioBaK9Ihu0uk","dataType":"compendium","name":"Longstrider (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/statue-hound-horned.webp","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pDnyX8JPF9SeanD6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Star Slinger (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/statue-hound-horned.webp","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qhDs2AuUaAegMUUO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Swarm Form (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/statue-hound-horned.webp","level":5,"_index":6}]},"tag":"spherewalker","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

This behavior is more than a tactical decision for stalwart defenders; it's an obsessive, stubborn expression of the need to be undefeated. When stalwart defenders set themselves in a defensive stance, they place their whole effort into weathering whatever foe, conflict, or threat comes their way. <br /><br />Most stalwart defenders come from the ranks of fighters, often those desiring to be better guards for friends and allies. Dwarves are particularly suited to the role, though stalwart defenders of all races exist. More rarely, barbarians take the path of the stalwart defender as a matter of pride, to overcome some perceived shortcoming. Such characters often seem to suffer from dual personalities, flinging themselves recklessly into combat one moment, then calmly fending off all attackers the next. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Stalwart defenders are masters of melee combat, striving to prove that the best offense is a good defense. Stalwart defenders are normally found on the front lines of battle, holding a position to cover their allies, leaping into breaches of opposing formations and holding them open for others, and guarding more vulnerable allies by acting as mobile fortifications, stable points in the ever-changing chaos of battle. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Anyone can be as stubborn as a rock and dedicated to holding one point no matter the cost, so stalwart defenders can be of any alignment. The dedication and practice required to learn the talents of a stalwart defender come more easily to characters with a strong respect for order and organization, however, so lawful stalwart defenders are much more common than chaotic ones.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a stalwart defender, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +7. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Dodge, Endurance, Toughness. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: Proficiency with light and medium armor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Stalwart Defender's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), and Sense Motive (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d12.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Defensive stance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Defensive power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Uncanny dodge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Defensive power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Damage reduction 1/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Defensive power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Damage reduction 3/-, improved uncanny dodge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Defensive power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Mobile defenses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.3204%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.2309%;\">Damage reduction 5/-, defensive power, last word</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the stalwart defender prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A stalwart defender is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and shields (including tower shields). <br /><br /><strong>AC Bonus (Ex)</strong>: A stalwart defender receives a dodge bonus to AC that starts at +1 and improves as the defender gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level. <br /><br /><strong>Defensive Stance (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trancelike determination. A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like <em>bear's endurance</em>, do not increase the total number of rounds that the stalwart defender can maintain a defensive stance per day. The stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance as a free action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. <br /><br />While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. The increase to Constitution grants the stalwart defender 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these hit points disappear when the defensive stance ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot willingly move from his current position through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves. If the stalwart defender moves under his own power as a result of an enemy's successful use of the Bluff skill or an enchantment spell, his stance ends. <br /><br />The stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free action; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the stance. A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart defender falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death. <br /><br />A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the rage spell). <br /><br /><strong>Defensive Powers (Ex)</strong>: As a stalwart defender gains levels, he augments his defensive stance. Starting at 2nd level, the stalwart defender gains a defensive power. He gains another defensive power for every two levels of stalwart defender attained after 2nd level. The stalwart defender gains the benefits of defensive powers only while in a defensive stance, and some of these powers require him to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, he cannot select an individual power more than once. <br /><br /><em>Bulwark (Ex)</em>: The defender adds his armor check penalty as a bonus to the DC of opponents attempting to Bluff him and Acrobatics checks to pass by him without provoking an attack of opportunity for moving through spaces he threatens. <br /><br /><em>Clear Mind (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender may reroll a failed Will save. This power is used as an immediate action after the first save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The stalwart defender must take the second result, even if it is worse. This power can only be used once per defensive stance. <br /><br /><em>Fearless Defense (Ex)</em>: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions. He must be at least 4th level before selecting this power. <br /><br /><em>Halting Blow (Ex)</em>: If a foe's movement in the defender's threatened area provokes an attack of opportunity and the stalwart defender successfully hits the foe with the attack, the foe's movement ends immediately. The foe cannot move again until its next turn but can still take the rest of its action. A stalwart defender must have selected the bulwark power prior to selecting halting blow. <br /><br /><em>Immobile (Ex)</em>: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender adds his class level to his CMD against any bull rush, overrun, pull, and push combat maneuvers, as well as grapple attempts to move him. The stalwart defender must be at least 4th level to select this power. <br /><br /><em>Increased Damage Reduction (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender's damage reduction from this class increases by 1/&mdash;. This increase is always active while the stalwart defender is in a defensive stance. He can select this power up to two times. Its effects stack. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level before selecting this defensive power. <br /><br /><em>Intercept (Ex)</em>: Once a round as an immediate action, when a melee or ranged weapon would successfully strike an adjacent ally, the stalwart defender can choose to have the weapon strike him instead of the intended target. The attack automatically hits the stalwart defender, regardless his AC or any miss chance in effect, and he suffers the normal consequences of the attack. <br /><br /><em>Internal Fortitude (Ex)</em>: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions. <br /><br /><em>Mighty Resilience (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender automatically negates the additional damage of one successful critical hit or sneak attack, as well as other abilities or effects that rely on a successful critical hit or sneak attack (such as blinding from Blinding Critical or bleed from sneak attack). The stalwart defender takes only normal damage from the attack. This power may only be used once per defensive stance. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level to select this power. <br /><br /><em>Renewed Defense (Ex)</em>: As a standard action, the stalwart defender heals 1d8 points of damage + his Constitution modifier. For every two levels the stalwart defender has attained above 2nd, this healing increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 10th level. This power can be used only once per day and only while in a defensive stance. <br /><br /><em>Roused Defense (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender may enter a defensive stance even if fatigued. While maintaining a defensive stance after using this ability, he is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this stance ends, he is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent in a defensive stance. <br /><br /><em>Smash (Ex)</em>: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender may make an extra attack per round that is either a shield bash or a slam (even if he doesn't normally have a slam attack). If used as part of a full attack action, the extra attack is made at the stalwart defender's full base attack bonus &ndash;5. The smash deals 1d4 points of damage (if the stalwart defender is Medium, or 1d3 if he is Small) plus half the character's Strength modifier. The character can make this attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple; this attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the attack hits, any grapple checks made by the stalwart defender against the target this round are at a +2 bonus. <br /><br /><em>Unexpected Strike (Ex)</em>: The stalwart defender can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the stalwart defender, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. This power can only be used once per stance. A stalwart defender must be at least 4th level before selecting this power. <br /><br /><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a stalwart defender gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flatfooted, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A stalwart defender with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him. <br /><br />If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below). <br /><br /><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a stalwart defender gains DR 1/&mdash;. At 7th level, this DR increases to 3/&mdash;, and at 10th level it increases to 5/&mdash;. Damage reduction from different sources does not stack; however, a stalwart defender of 5th or higher level that gains DR from armor (but not from any other source) increases his class-based DR by the value of the armor's DR. Thus a 7th-level stalwart defender wearing adamantine full plate (DR 3/&mdash;) has DR 6/&mdash;. <br /><br /><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a stalwart defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the stalwart defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the stalwart defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). <br /><br />If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (see above), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character. <br /><br /><strong>Mobile Defense (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a stalwart defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance. <br /><br /><strong>Last Word (Ex)</strong>: Once per day, while in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender can make one melee attack against an opponent within reach in response to an attack that would reduce him to negative hit points, knock him unconscious, or kill him. For example, a stalwart defender has 1 hit point left when a red dragon bites him; the defender may use this ability even if the dragon's bite would otherwise kill him instantly. If the attack hits, roll the damage dice for the attack twice and add the results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), or precision-based damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are multiplied normally). Once the defender's attack is resolved, he suffers the normal effect of the attack that provoked this ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EC3p8ctSreBlNBrS","dataType":"compendium","name":"AC Bonus (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-steel-gold.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.A3QO3Z9rRKiyheCF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Damage Reduction (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-steel-gold.webp","level":5,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TfIhNvaOmjUVBUMi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Defensive Powers (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-steel-gold.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tqJwOCmypbhz2Lu3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Defensive Stance (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-steel-gold.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ksKgOAZbusUoUCUl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Last Word (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-steel-gold.webp","level":10,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lJxcwaUHltkOxmSg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mobile Defense (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-steel-gold.webp","level":9,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.34cozBOrCRMVcQsI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Uncanny Dodge (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-steel-gold.webp","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eHMTti0dm5QFmbVW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-steel-gold.webp","level":7,"_index":7}]},"tag":"stalwartDefender","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","hvy","shl","twr"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":12,"hp":12,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

From calling down the holy fires of Iomedae to saying a quiet prayer on behalf of the dead to Pharasma, any expression of religious worship or spiritual proselytization is a crime punishable by fines, exile, imprisonment&mdash;or worse. These anti-religion laws, part of a larger code known as the Laws of Man, were originally created as the solution to the Oath Wars, a decades-long series of holy wars between the faithful of Sarenrae and followers of Nethys and Norgorber that ravaged Rahadoum centuries ago.<br /><br />The Pure Legion is a government-sponsored military organization created to enforce the Laws of Man within Rahadoum&rsquo;s borders and territorial waters. While the Pure Legion employs many different types of agents, most are simple soldiers who double as city guards. The enforcers, however, are investigators and spies who specialize in ferreting out hidden cults, clandestine relic smugglers, subversive philosophers, and religious terrorists. They might lead squads of rankand- file legionnaires, operate in pairs, or work alone. Though their methods vary, all Pure Legion enforcers are dedicated to keeping their nation free of the gods&rsquo; shackles by tracking down and purging any divine influence from the Kingdom of Man. Some take on an atheistic fervor that rivals the zealotry of those they seek to keep out of Rahadoum, but most enforcers are simply incredibly skilled at their jobs rather than suffering from any kind of mind-clouding ideology.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Pure Legion enforcer, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any lawful.<br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Cannot worship a deity.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Godless Healing<sup>ISWG</sup>.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, Sense Motive 4 ranks.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Cannot cast divine spells.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Pure Legion Enforcer's class skills are Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Aura sense, nonbeliever</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Divine detective, voice of law</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Improved godless healing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Confiscate, decree of law</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Discern lies, disruptive critical</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Edict of law</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Iconoclast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Absolute law</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Traces of divinity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25455%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.9819%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4283%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.8715%;\">Iron-willed atheist</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Pure Legion enforcer prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A Pure Legion enforcer is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the falchion, scimitar, and shortbow. Pure Legion enforcers are proficient with all light and medium armor and shields (except tower shields).<br /><br /><strong>Aura Sense (Sp)</strong>: A Pure Legion enforcer can cast <em>detect chaos/evil/good/law </em>at will as a spell-like ability, though he can detect only auras of moderate or higher power. He can detect only one type of aura at any given time.<br /><br /><strong>Nonbeliever (Su)</strong>: A Pure Legion enforcer gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1) on saving throws against divine spells and spell-like abilities granted by a divine spellcasting class. The enforcer must always attempt a saving throw against the effects of beneficial divine magic.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Detective (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Pure Legion enforcer gains the ability to cast <em>detect magic </em>at will as a spell-like ability. He also receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his Pure Legion enforcer level on checks to identify religious paraphernalia, divine spells, or magic items that are divine in nature (such as divine scrolls, aligned weapons, and magic items keyed to specific deities). This bonus also applies to Spellcraft checks to identify the casting of divine spells, Knowledge (religion) checks to identify nonmagical religious items and iconography, and Perception checks to detect hidden or concealed holy symbols.<br /><br /><strong>Voice of Law (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Pure Legion enforcer can, as a standard action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all worshipers of a specific deity within 30 feet. Spellcasters who are affected by this ability also take a &ndash;4 penalty on concentration checks to cast divine spells as long as they are shaken.<br /><br /><strong>Improved Godless Healing (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Pure Legion enforcer can benefit from the Godless Healing feat one additional time per day, and heals an additional 1d8 points of damage for every 3 levels he possesses, to a maximum of an additional 3d8 points of damage healed at 9th level.<br /><br /><strong>Confiscate (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, the Pure Legion enforcer gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm or steal (<em>Advanced Players Guide </em>322) divine paraphernalia and magic items (such as aligned weapons, divine scrolls, holy or unholy symbols, and items affiliated with a specific deity). He can attempt disarm and steal combat maneuvers against such targets without provoking an attack of opportunity.<br /><br /><strong>Decree of Law (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, the Pure Legion enforcer can use his voice of law ability as a move action. Additionally, the enforcer gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures affected by his voice of law ability.<br /><br /><strong>Discern Lies (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, a Pure Legion enforcer can <em>discern lies</em>, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to his enforcer level. These rounds don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.<br /><br /><strong>Disruptive Critical (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, when a Pure Legion enforcer confirms a critical hit against a divine spellcaster, he temporarily severs the divine conduit between the spellcaster and her deity, preventing her from casting divine spells or using supernatural or spell-like abilities granted by divine spellcasting classes. This effect lasts for 1 round per level or until the spellcaster succeeds at a concentration check (DC = 20 + 1/2 the enforcer&rsquo;s class level + his Charisma modifier).<br /><br /><strong>Edict of Law (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, the Pure Legion enforcer can use his voice of law ability as a swift action, and if he is successful, creatures affected are shaken for a minimum of 1 minute instead of 1 round. The duration of this effect is still increased by 1 round for every 5 by which the enforcer exceeds the DC.<br /><br /><strong>Iconoclast (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a Pure Legion enforcer gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver attempts to sunder divine paraphernalia and magic items. He can attempt sunder combat maneuvers against such items without provoking an attack of opportunity.<br /><br /><strong>Absolute Law (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, the Pure Legion enforcer&rsquo;s damage bonus against creatures affected by his voice of law ability increases to +4.<br /><br /><strong>Traces of Divinity (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, a Pure Legion enforcer can detect the lingering effects of magic long after the spell&rsquo;s duration has expired. When using <em>detect magic </em>on a lingering aura from a divine spell or a spell-like ability granted from a divine spellcasting class, the enforcer treats the original aura as one strength level higher than it actually was when determining its duration. If the enforcer exceeds the Spellcraft check to identify the spell by 5 or more, he can sense the same dim aura upon the spell&rsquo;s caster within the extended duration of his <em>detect magic </em>spell.<br /><br /><strong>Iron-Willed Atheist (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Pure Legion enforcer gains spell resistance equal to 11 + his character level against divine spellcasting and spell-like abilities granted by a divine spellcasting class. A Pure Legion enforcer cannot voluntarily lower his spell resistance. Additionally, his damage bonus against creatures affected by his voice of law ability increases to +6.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.c61UW4qjDBxLEBaK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aura Sense (Sp)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.BGd5i33PQ1AiBBMK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Nonbeliever (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cRntFAMgTGBFSQhN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Detective (Sp)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4cNd8JT1ObquZuj9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Voice of Law (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vuuB3MSPZUayNhXF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Godless Healing (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.oI019H6rZvmsRMts","dataType":"compendium","name":"Confiscate (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pqWmGx4Q29QZvoic","dataType":"compendium","name":"Decree of Law (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":4,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.X3g7olsjsde4BqvF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Disruptive Critical (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":5,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1GzwbdUfwooiRKjW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Discern Lies (Sp)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":5,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mBPJt3zifx5ttPIe","dataType":"compendium","name":"Edict of Law (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":6,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gsBI2aOv9G2YgRKX","dataType":"compendium","name":"Iconoclast (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":7,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LG38OUvqdBRgMGeY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Absolute Law (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":8,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gvL49dMLxTMbJlij","dataType":"compendium","name":"Traces of Divinity (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":9,"_index":12},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2Vnjiwl9rDamZrn4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Iron-Willed Atheist (Su)","img":"icons/weapons/maces/mace-round-spiked-black.webp","level":10,"_index":13}]},"tag":"pureLegionEnforcer","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":"Falchion, Scimitar, and Shortbow"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Most tribal holds have only a single asavir, who leads infantry in defending the hold and distracting invaders while the tribe&rsquo;s light cavalry sweep around behind invading forces. An asavir&rsquo;s bond with her genie-blessed mount is even closer than the partnership most Al-Zabriti share with their horses, and her human compatriots fight with extra ferocity, knowing that they have a tireless protector. Asavirs sometimes leave their tribe to become mercenaries or adventurers, and it is from such asavirs that the techniques of this prestige class are usually spread to those outside of Al-Zabrit (much to traditionalists&rsquo; chagrin). As members of the devoutly Sarenite tribes of Al-Zabrit, asavirs tend toward nonevil alignments. Asavirs outside the region exhibit a wide range of alignments, though those with chaotic alignments generally find that the discipline of the Imperial Forces discourages them from making a career of military service. Given the importance of family and tribal affiliations to Al-Zabriti identity, asavirs who are exiled from their tribes might slide into evil alignments out of despondence or resentment.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an asavir, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +4. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Mounted Combat. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Handle Animal 5 ranks, Ride 5 ranks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Asavir's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Survival (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Camaraderie +1, equine bond</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Shaitan's blessing +2, thunderous charge (5 ft.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Aura of courage, flank breaker</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Djinni's blessing (10 ft.), controlled charge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Camaraderie +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Marid's blessing, thunderous charge (10 ft.), trampling gallop</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">All eyes on me</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Djinni's blessing (20 ft.), efreeti's blessing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Camaraderie +3, inspiring leader, Shaitan's blessing +4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.3821%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9642%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.37989%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.2588%;\">Janni's blessing, thunderous charge (20 ft.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the asavir prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: An asavir is proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, and all forms of armor and shields (except tower shields).<br /><br /><strong>Camaraderie (Ex)</strong>: An asavir is skilled at forging those who battle by her side into a loyal and well-coordinated team and exhorting them to fight bravely. As long as the asavir can speak aloud, the bonus she grants to any allies within 30 feet when she takes the aid another action in combat increases by 1. At 5th level, the bonus instead increases by 2, and at 9th level, it instead increases by 3. These bonuses do not stack with other abilities that enhance the aid another action.<br /><br /><strong>Equine Bond (Ex)</strong>: An asavir gains a horse as a loyal steed. This mount functions as a druid&rsquo;s animal companion, using the asavir&rsquo;s level + 2 as her effective druid level (for example, at 3rd level, the asavir&rsquo;s mount functions as a 5th-level druid&rsquo;s animal companion). The companion must be a horse or pony, though the GM might approve other equine animals as suitable mounts (especially in the case of unusually large or small asavirs). If the asavir has a horse companion from another class that grants a similar ability (such as cavalier<sup>APG</sup>, druid, or ranger), her asavir levels stack with levels from one of these other classes (her choice) for the purposes of determining her mount&rsquo;s statistics and abilities&mdash;she does not gain a second companion for having this ability from a different class. Her total effective druid level for determining her mount&rsquo;s statistics can never exceed her total character level. An asavir doesn&rsquo;t take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding her mount, and her mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat.<br /><br /><strong> Shaitan&rsquo;s Blessing (Su)</strong>: When an asavir reaches 2nd level, her mount receives the blessing of the shaitans. It receives a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting and fear effects. When the asavir reaches 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.<br /><br /><strong> Thunderous Charge (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a number of times per day equal to her asavir level, an asavir and her mount can make a charge that causes the ground to shake. This is a full-round action and works as a normal charge, except the asavir&rsquo;s mount can move only up to its move speed (not double its move speed, as in a normal charge). Creatures within a 5-foot radius of the charge&rsquo;s ending point must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + the asavir&rsquo;s class level + the mount&rsquo;s Strength modifier) or fall prone. For every asavir level above 2nd the character has, she can exclude one creature from the effects of her thunderous charge (one creature at 3rd level, up to a maximum of eight creatures at 10th level). The asavir can resolve her attack at the end of her charge either before or after determining which creatures fall prone. At 6th level, the radius of thunderous charge increases to 10 feet, and at 10th level it increases to 20 feet.<br /><br /><strong> Aura of Courage (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, an asavir gains an aura of courage like that of a 3rd-level paladin.<br /><br /><strong> Flank Breaker (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, if an asavir successfully damages a foe that is flanking an ally, she can attempt a special combat maneuver check against the target&rsquo;s CMD as a swift action. If she succeeds, that foe is unable to flank with any creature for 1 round.<br /><br /><strong> Controlled Charge (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, an asavir learns to attack with greater accuracy from the back of a charging mount. She gains a +4 bonus on melee attacks on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2) and does not take a penalty to her AC after making a charge attack while mounted.<br /><br /><strong> Djinni&rsquo;s Blessing (Su)</strong>: When an asavir reaches 4th level, her mount receives the blessing of the djinn, making it swift and tireless. The mount&rsquo;s speed increases by 10 feet, it doesn&rsquo;t take movement penalties from wearing barding, and it can carry a second rider without penalties. When the asavir reaches 8th level, her mount&rsquo;s speed increases by an additional 10 feet.<br /><br /><strong> Marid&rsquo;s Blessing (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, an asavir&rsquo;s mount receives the blessing of the marids, making it an agile partner with a flowing pace. Anyone riding the mount does not need to attempt concentration checks normally required because of the mount&rsquo;s movement. The mount gains a +2 racial bonus on Reflex saves.<br /><br /><strong> Trampling Gallop (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, an asavir&rsquo;s mount gains the trample universal monster ability, but only when commanded by the asavir as a full-round action. Damage dealt by the trample is equal to that of the horse&rsquo;s hoof attack plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.<br /><br /><strong> All Eyes on Me (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, three times per day as a swift action, an asavir can call out a challenge. Each opponent within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the asavir&rsquo;s character level + the asavir&rsquo;s Charisma bonus) or be distracted by the display until the beginning of the asavir&rsquo;s next turn. Any creature that fails is considered to be flat-footed and takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC against attacks from the asavir&rsquo;s allies. This is a mind-affecting, visual effect.<br /><br /><strong> Efreeti&rsquo;s Blessing (Su)</strong>: When an asavir reaches 8th level, her mount receives the blessing of the efreet, gaining fire resistance 5. It also deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with its hoof attacks.<br /><br /><strong> Inspiring Leader (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, an asavir can call out encouragement to her allies as a move action, bolstering their courage. Allies within 60 feet of the asavir who can hear her receive a morale bonus equal to the asavir&rsquo;s Charisma bonus on attack and damage rolls with weapons for 1 round. An asavir can use this ability three times per day. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect.<br /><br /><strong> Janni&rsquo;s Blessing (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, when an asavir rolls a d20 to resolve an attack, saving throw, or skill check, she can roll twice and choose the better result. The asavir can use this ability once per day for herself and once per day for her mount. Both the asavir and her mount gain a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kEaLph8TbFT4rW3r","dataType":"compendium","name":"Camaraderie (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.X0tGpISvrvBwb180","dataType":"compendium","name":"Equine Bond (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6Ouq3IotfDzfos5z","dataType":"compendium","name":"Shaitan's Blessing (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.0nv33ONVpRz7g41J","dataType":"compendium","name":"Thunderous Charge (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.DxiQ7EiOese2Wqtu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aura of Courage (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WKMhwsJE0zYAlRiw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Flank Breaker (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2ktGOjprQvFwgAup","dataType":"compendium","name":"Controlled Charge (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":4,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kDwFJNF9CGEWbU5G","dataType":"compendium","name":"Djinni's Blessing (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":4,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.UbYjMsQ8DDXRaX84","dataType":"compendium","name":"Marid's Blessing (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":6,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.norxLYdyNUhxlaVY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Trampling Gallop (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":6,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QOgv8IpxnWix0Vbv","dataType":"compendium","name":"All Eyes on Me (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":7,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LvEiDSK5DzAu9QFo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Efreeti's Blessing (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":8,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ahdy9OKEg3cSl1Qz","dataType":"compendium","name":"Inspiring Leader (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":9,"_index":12},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Got8x5eMbGLgR2lc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Janni's Blessing (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/ride-by-attack.jpg","level":10,"_index":13}]},"tag":"asavir","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","hvy","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Asavir","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They move with a grace unmatched by most foes, parrying blows and countering attacks with swift thrusts of their blades. They may wear armor, but generally eschew such bulky protection as their grace allows them to dodge their opponents with ease. While others flounder on treacherous terrain, duelists charge nimbly across the battlefield, leaping and tumbling into the fray. They thrive in melee, where their skill with the blade allows them to make sudden attacks against clumsy foes and to cripple opponents with particularly well-placed thrusts of the blade. <br /><br />The path to the duelist is natural for rogues and bards, as those classes do not rely on armor for defense, although nearly as many duelists come from the ranks of fighters and rangers. They are often found in those regions that possess elaborate rules and etiquette for battle. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: The abilities of duelists complement those rogues or bards who wish to accentuate their fighting prowess but, because of their lack of heavy armor, are afraid to leap into combat. Duelists fight in the forefront alongside fighters, barbarians, and other melee combatants, deftly avoiding the blades of their opponents while expertly targeting their vulnerabilities. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Duelists can be of any alignment, although since most hail from backgrounds as rogues or bards, they tend to eschew lawful behavior. Lawful duelists are not unheard of, however, and such duelists often adhere to a strict code of honor, refusing to attack unarmed or obviously inferior opponents.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a duelist, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +6. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Acrobatics 2 ranks, Perform 2 ranks. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Dodge, Mobility, Weapon Finesse.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Duelist's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), and Sense Motive (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Canny defense, precise strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Improved reaction +2, parry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Enhanced mobility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Combat Reflexes, grace</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Riposte</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Acrobatic charge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Elaborate defense</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Improved reaction +4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Deflect Arrows, no retreat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.01769%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.7775%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.5456%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.9404%;\">Crippling critical</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />All of the following are class features of the duelist prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: The duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Duelists are proficient with light armor but not with shields. <br /><br /><strong>Canny Defense (Ex)</strong>: When wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, a duelist adds 1 point of Intelligence bonus (if any) per duelist class level as a dodge bonus to her Armor Class while wielding a melee weapon. If a duelist is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus. <br /><br /><strong>Precise Strike (Ex)</strong>: A duelist gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, adding her duelist level to her damage roll. <br /><br />When making a precise strike, a duelist cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield. A duelist's precise strike only works against living creatures with discernible anatomies. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is also immune to a precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from a precise strike. <br /><br /><strong>Improved Reaction (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a duelist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. At 8th level, the bonus increases to +4. This bonus stacks with the benefit provided by the Improved Initiative feat. <br /><br /><strong>Parry (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a duelist learns to parry the attacks of other creatures, causing them to miss. Whenever the duelist takes a full attack action with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she can elect not to take one of her attacks. At any time before her next turn, she can attempt to parry an attack against her or an adjacent ally as an immediate action. To parry the attack, the duelist makes an attack roll, using the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forego during her previous action. If her attack roll is greater than the roll of the attacking creature, the attack automatically misses. For each size category that the attacking creature is larger than the duelist, the duelist takes a &ndash;4 penalty on her attack roll. The duelist also takes a &ndash;4 penalty when attempting to parry an attack made against an adjacent ally. The duelist must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made. <br /><br /><strong>Enhanced Mobility (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 3rd level, when wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an additional +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of a threatened square. <br /><br /><strong>Combat Reflexes</strong>: At 4th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the Combat Reflexes feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon. <br /><br /><strong>Grace (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is wearing light or no armor and not using a shield. <br /><br /><strong>Riposte (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 5th level, a duelist can make an attack of opportunity against any creature whose attack she successfully parries, so long as the creature she is attacking is within reach. <br /><br /><strong>Acrobatic Charge (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a duelist gains the ability to charge in situations where others cannot. She may charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement. Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks to successfully move over the terrain. <br /><br /><strong>Elaborate Defense (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level and higher, if a duelist chooses to fight defensively or use total defense in melee combat, she gains an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC for every 3 levels of duelist she has attained. <br /><br /><strong>Deflect Arrows</strong>: At 9th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the Deflect Arrows feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon. The duelist does not need a free hand to use this feat. <br /><br /><strong>No Retreat (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, enemies adjacent to the duelist that take a withdraw action provoke an attack of opportunity from the duelist. <br /><br /><strong>Crippling Critical (Ex)</strong>: When you confirm a critical hit using a light or one-handed piercing weapon, you can apply one of the following penalties in addition to the damage dealt: reduce all of the target's speeds by 10 feet (minimum 5 feet), 1d4 points of Strength or Dexterity damage, &ndash;4 penalty on all saving throws, &ndash;4 penalty to Armor Class, or 2d6 points of bleed damage. These penalties last for 1 minute, except for ability damage, which must be healed normally, and bleed damage, which continues until the target receives magic healing or a DC 15 Heal skill check.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FGSNExAIFZHOOzhH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Canny Defense (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.N3Fe6coQBltXlek0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Acrobatic Charge (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":6,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.RaIFYQXqA6hKuy8O","dataType":"compendium","name":"Combat Reflexes","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":4,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FDzGt76mgBoE0TZA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Crippling Critical (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":10,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5xuLpxXzvR5gqSr7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deflect Arrows","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":9,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1bbUc5ZWYtejVowt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Elaborate Defense (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":7,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.F7NpyESgyDR5iXcy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Enhanced Mobility (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sz8ik4RHW6i3EAA4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Grace (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":4,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.H1Q8sFII3c4Rxwow","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Reaction (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":2,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.H6yh82gZtkrVlITI","dataType":"compendium","name":"No Retreat (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":9,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lArTp0nZBJmBZfjN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Parry (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":2,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.t02ez5jnOETE5qvc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Precise Strike (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":1,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ApDYFmYQLd0gaQzI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Riposte (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting.jpg","level":5,"_index":12}]},"tag":"duelist","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The caster level for powers that duplicate spell effects is equal to the living monolith&rsquo;s character level.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A living monolith gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Soul Stone (Su)</strong>: During his induction into this prestige class, a living monolith has a stone scarab embedded in his forehead, often set with gems or inlaid with precious metals. This stone is inscribed on its inner side with the monolith&rsquo;s true name and his oaths to the gods and pharaohs. It cannot be removed without his permission, cannot be dispelled (though it does not function in areas where magic does not work), and does not use a magic item slot.<br /><br />The soul stone grants the living monolith a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects, mind-affecting effects, effects that grant negative levels, and on saves to overcome negative levels.<br /><br />A living monolith can invoke the power of his soul stone 3 times per day as a swift action, enabling him to grow in size as if using <em>enlarge person </em>(even if he is not a humanoid).<br /><br />When a living monolith first gains the soul stone ability, he must decide whether it takes the form of an ib stone or a ka stone. If the character was a spellcaster before becoming a living monolith, he can choose either an ib stone or a ka stone. If the character was not a spellcaster before becoming a living monolith, he must take a ka stone.<br /><br /><em>Ib Stone (Su)</em>: Starting at 2nd level, a living monolith with an ib stone gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a living monolith, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. A living monolith with an ib stone does not gain the greater ka stone and master ka stone abilities.<br /><br /><em>Ka Stone (Su)</em>: A living monolith with a ka stone gains Toughness as bonus feat. In addition, when a living monolith uses his ka stone to increase his size, his base attack bonus from his living monolith class levels is equal to his living monolith level.<br /><br /><strong>Stone Blood (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, the vital fluids and tissues of a living monolith can selectively petrify in response to injury. A living monolith automatically stabilizes when at negative hit points and is immune to continuous damage from bleed attacks (including weapons with the <em>wounding</em> special ability) and ability damage from blood drain.<br /><br /><strong>Fortified Flesh (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, the flesh of a living monolith takes on the hardness of stone. A living monolith gains DR 1/&mdash; and 10% immunity to critical hits and sneak attacks (as if wearing <em>fortification </em>armor). At 5th level and again at 8th level, this DR increases by 1 and the immunity to critical hits increases by 10%. When a living monolith uses his soul stone to increase his size, these defenses temporarily increase by an additional 1 and 10%, respectively. At 5th level, a living monolith becomes immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot).<br /><br /><strong>Stability (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a living monolith becomes exceptionally stable on his feet, gaining a +4 bonus to his CMD when he resists a bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground. This stacks with a dwarf &rsquo;s stability trait and similar abilities.<br /><br /><strong>Tombsight (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a living monolith can perceive the balance of life and death within those he sees, as if using <em>deathwatch </em>and <em>detect undead </em>simultaneously. This power can be used at will and lasts as long as the living monolith concentrates.<br /><br /><strong>Greater Ka Stone (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, when a living monolith with a ka stone invokes his ka stone&rsquo;s power to increase his size, the living monolith gains the benefit of <em>righteous might</em> rather than <em>enlarge person</em>. The DR gained from <em>righteous might </em>is based on the living monolith&rsquo;s alignment. A neutral living monolith must choose which DR to gain from this ability. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.<br /><br /><strong>Attunement to Stone (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, a living monolith can use <em>meld into stone </em>at will.<br /><br /><strong>Summon Sphinx (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, a living monolith can call upon the aid of the sphinxes, ancient allies of the first immortal tomb guardians of Osirion. Once per day, the living monolith can call a sphinx to his presence and bargain for its services as if using <em>planar ally </em>to call upon an outsider. At 9th level, this ability functions as <em>greater planar ally</em>. The living monolith gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence sphinxes.<br /><br /><strong>Communion with Stone (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a living monolith achieves a unique communion with the earth, gaining tremorsense to a range of 30 feet. Once per day, the living monolith can communicate with rock and stone as if using <em>stone tell</em>. He gains Terran as a bonus language.<br /><br /><strong>Assumption of Stone (Sp)</strong>: At 9th level, a living monolith may use <em>statue </em>as a spell-like ability with a range of personal at will. He also becomes immune to petrification.<br /><br /><strong>Ageless Stone (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a living monolith becomes immortal. He ceases aging (though any aging effects already accrued remain in place) and becomes immune to energy drain and death effects, though he can still be killed by other means.<br /><br /><strong>Judgment of the Monolith (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, a living monolith gains the divine authority to demand truthful answers. Once per day, a living monolith can conduct a ritual of inquisition. If performed on a dead body, this functions as <em>speak with dead</em>. Upon a living creature, it functions as a <em>mark of justice </em>that activates if the target lies to the living monolith. A living monolith can also use this power to entreat the spirits of the living and the dead to answer questions as if using <em>contact other plane </em>(treat as contacting a lesser deity).<br /><br /><strong>Master Ka Stone (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, when a living monolith with a ka stone invokes his ka stone&rsquo;s power to increase his size, he regains lost hit points as if he had rested for a night. This healing does not restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of resting, and changing back does not heal him further.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Wp3ebKMwGBGsNBus","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ageless Stone (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":10,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.uSDamJbUefOqi2jH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Assumption of Stone (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":9,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9Ghk4ooekbU8dQlo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Attunement to Stone (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":6,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.GLYwOBgXzNVDF4X7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Communion with Stone (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":8,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wdi1pSAXbTqBMeGx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Fortified Flesh (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TPgGWx29OfXTZ6gs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Ka Stone (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8MY9QSPo50R5jbsh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Judgment of the Monolith (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":10,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.v3xCNyiRakKEo1sT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master Ka Stone (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":10,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5q20EcI3V9MD2Vta","dataType":"compendium","name":"Soul Stone (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":1,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TxCpMYXkcluFttnz","dataType":"compendium","name":"Stability (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":4,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.azE7KK0oD6nUomJy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Stone Blood (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":2,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lERtmvBNYcOq7bxB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Summon Sphinx (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":7,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PthfuQ3c1cELtzG8","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tombsight (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/cave-entrance-dwarven-hill.webp","level":4,"_index":12}]},"tag":"livingMonolith","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":true,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

He makes his presence felt through demands of fealty, ever-increasing tithes, and the less-than-gentle hands of his most devout subjects. Of these devotees, it is Razmir&rsquo;s clergy that most accurately represents the fervor of their lord. They roam the lands spreading word of the power of Razmir, and using that power to convince the unfaithful of their misplaced loyalties in other gods and governments.<br /><br />The Razmiran priest, one of the most powerful of Razmir&rsquo;s servants, brings the Living God&rsquo;s gifts to the common folk and his wrath to his enemies. From behind his mask, the priest judges all he sees, meting out harsh justice in the name of his deity. Many doubt the powers of the clergy, and some would even dare to call Razmir &ldquo;false.&rdquo; These fools soon learn the error of their ways when the Razmiran priest pays them a visit, using the gifts of the god to smite such heretics.<br /><br />A devotee who wishes to become one of Razmir&rsquo;s most trusted priests must undergo a lengthy ritual in the capital of Thronestep. It is said that Razmir himself conducts the final steps of the ritual, blessing the new priest and judging his purity. Those who are found worthy emerge from this secret, mysterious process as absolute believers, while those deemed inadequate are never seen again. A new Razmiran priest finds himself on a quick path to power, prestige, and wealth, as the hierarchy of Razmir&rsquo;s faith treats most priests as superiors. Indeed, many Razmiran priests find themselves quickly rising in rank to become Heralds of the Eighth Step or possessors of even greater power in short order.</span></p>\n<h2

gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Domain of Razmir</strong>: A Razmiran priest may select one of the following domains: Charm, Evil, Law, or Trickery. A Razmiran priest gains the granted powers of that domain, using his arcane spellcaster level as his cleric level and his Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher) in place of his Wisdom modifier. He does not gain any domain spells from this domain.<br /><br />At 5th level, a Razmiran priest may select a second domain from those listed above and may use the granted powers of that domain as well.<br /><br /><strong>First Ritual (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a Razmiran adds both <em>bless</em> and <em>cure light wounds </em>to one of his arcane spell lists, but treats them as if they were 2nd-level spells. If he is a spontaneous caster, they are also added to his list of spells known. Whenever he casts <em>cure light wounds </em>using this ability, the hit points healed are instead treated as temporary hit points that last 10 minutes per Razmiran priest level, although the subject of the spell does not notice this difference until the duration expires. Temporary hit points from this (and any subsequent cure spells) do not stack.<br /><br />In addition, whenever a Razmiran priest uses False Casting to cast a 0- or 1st-level spell on the cleric spell list, he receives a +10 circumstance bonus on any opposed Bluff check made when casting the spell.<br /><br /><strong>False Channel (Su)</strong>: Starting at 2nd level, a Razmiran priest can channel positive energy to heal living creatures like a cleric, healing 1d6 points of damage, plus 1d6 points of damage for every two Razmiran priest levels after 2nd. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). The hit points healed by this ability are treated as temporary hit points, and last for 10 minutes per Razmiran priest level. These hit points do not stack with themselves (although they do stack with those from <em>cure light wounds</em> cast using the first ritual class feature). This ability does not count for the purposes of meeting any prerequisites that call for the ability to channel energy. This ability cannot be used to harm undead creatures.<br /><br /><strong>Master of Lies (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Razmiran priest adds his class level to any Bluff check made as part of a lie or deception. In addition, whenever he is subject to a spell or special ability that can discern whether or not he is telling the truth, he is automatically aware of such magic. He is not immune to such spells or abilities, but he can choose to remain silent or avoid answering questions.<br /><br /><strong>Second Ritual (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a Razmiran priest adds <em>cure moderate wounds</em> and <em>spiritual weapon </em>to one of his arcane spell lists, but treats them as if they were 3rd-level spells. If he is a spontaneous caster, they are also added to his list of spells known. As with the first ritual, any hit points gained from <em>cure moderate wounds </em>are temporary hit points. Finally, whenever a Razmiran priest uses False Casting to cast a 2nd- or 3rd-level spell on the cleric spell list, he receives a +10 circumstance bonus on any opposed Bluff check made when casting the spell.<br /><br /><strong>Conversion (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, whenever a Razmiran priest heals himself using false channel, the effect heals damage, instead of granting temporary hit points. This has no effect on others in the area of effect.<br /><br /><strong>Third Ritual (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, a Razmiran priest adds <em>cure serious wounds </em>and <em>prayer </em>to one of his arcane spell lists, but treats them as if they were 4th-level spells. If he is a spontaneous caster, they are also added to his list of spells known. As with the first ritual, any hit points gained from <em>cure serious wounds </em>are temporary hit points. Finally, whenever a Razmiran priest uses False Casting to cast a 4th- or 5th-level spell on the cleric spell list, he receives a +10 circumstance bonus on any opposed Bluff check made when casting the spell.<br /><br /><strong>True Pretender (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Razmiran priest attains true power. Whenever he uses false channel, he can spend two uses of that ability to heal damage to all living creatures in the area, instead of granting temporary hit points. In addition, when determining what spell trigger and spell completion magic items he can use, he acts as though all cleric spells were on his spell list. This makes it so that he does not need to make a Use Magic Device skill check when using such items, but he must still make Bluff skill checks when using False Casting with such spells.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.0g7AZD0jFcwoWQJi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Domain of Razmir","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-sky-3.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5rIcn7X0y78TqKor","dataType":"compendium","name":"First Ritual (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-sky-3.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2RISH43xwfRAVvrV","dataType":"compendium","name":"False Channel (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-sky-3.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8L0STp1QlPN2n5m8","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master of Lies (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-sky-3.jpg","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3BofvEJKeLJa2bxJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Second Ritual (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-sky-3.jpg","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3FufkpC8iQ3kGZYg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Conversion (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-sky-3.jpg","level":7,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mcOTEtvfbuYaDnxx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Third Ritual (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-sky-3.jpg","level":9,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rzyMmrd14egz5UrV","dataType":"compendium","name":"True Pretender (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-sky-3.jpg","level":10,"_index":7}]},"tag":"razmiranPriest","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Though seemingly at odds with this perception of barbarism, Ulfen are also known for their staunch loyalty, strong sense of honor, and unyielding resolve. The combination of these reputations is in large part why they have become desired as bodyguards throughout the region. Nowhere is this practice more pronounced than in Taldor, where Ulfen have become ensconced in the Taldan tradition and adopted as the elite bodyguards of Grand Prince Stavian III himself. Ulfen Guards, as outsiders, are generally thought to have no ulterior motives or secret loyalty to other Taldan families or political organizations; their honor keeps them loyal to the crown. An Ulfen Guard is required to be of at least half- Ulfen descent, with one or both parents hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Non-Ulfen may serve the organization in a support capacity, but may not be Ulfen Guards themselves. While the Ulfen Guards are officially Stavian III&rsquo;s personal bodyguards, he often has them perform other tasks that take them all over the Inner Sea region, protecting his interests as well as his person, or operating secretly under the auspices of traveling Ulfen merchants, raiding seafarers, or unaffiliated mercenaries, all the while serving the Taldan crown.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an Ulfen Guard, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (nobility) 2 ranks, Perception 5 ranks, Sense Motive 3 ranks.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Ulfen descent.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Ulfen Guard's class skills are Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Chosen ally, guard dedication, rage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Guarded thoughts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Guard dedication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Adaptable guardian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Guard dedication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Tight follower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Guard dedication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Reactive strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Guard dedication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.9031%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Unbreakable defender</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Ulfen Guard prestige class.<br />@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pgixjJZ2e5K2zd2E]{Chosen Ally (Ex)}<br /><strong>Chosen Ally (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, when entering a rage, an Ulfen Guard can choose an ally to protect as a free action. The Ulfen Guard must make this choice when beginning her rage and cannot change her designated ally while raging. Whenever the Ulfen Guard is adjacent to her chosen ally, she can choose to take a &ndash;1 penalty to her AC to grant her ally a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th and 10th level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NKUVAqFlA93zmC4E]{Guard Dedications}<br /><strong>Guard Dedications</strong>: At 1st level, and at every 2 levels thereafter, an Ulfen Guard chooses a guard dedication from the list below. An Ulfen Guard cannot choose a guard dedication more than once unless the dedication specifies otherwise.<br /><br /><em>Alert Guardian (Ex)</em>: An Ulfen Guard with this dedication can enter a rage as an immediate action, and can do so even when flat-footed or during a surprise round in which she cannot otherwise act.<br /><br /><em>Clothed in Civilization (Ex)</em>: The Ulfen Guard gains proficiency in heavy armor. At 5th level, if the Ulfen Guard has the barbarian fast movement ability, she can use her fast movement ability while wearing heavy armor. This does not negate the penalties to movement imposed by the armor itself.<br /><br /><em>Curiosity (Ex)</em>: The Ulfen Guard&rsquo;s peculiar nature makes her an object of intrigue. Civilized people are fascinated by the &ldquo;tamed&rdquo; barbarian, while more barbaric cultures are fascinated by her choice to turn her back on her heritage. The Ulfen Guard gains a bonus equal to her class level on Diplomacy checks.<br /><br /><em>Deflect Arrows (Ex)</em>: The Ulfen Guard gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. If she is adjacent to her chosen ally, she can use this ability to deflect an arrow targeting her chosen ally. The Ulfen Guard does not need to meet the prerequisites for this bonus feat.<br /><br /><em>Formal Training (Ex)</em>: When selecting this dedication, the Ulfen Guard gains a bonus feat. She must select this feat from the list of fighter bonus feats. Additionally, the Ulfen Guard adds her level to any levels of fighter she has for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats (if she has no fighter levels, treat her Ulfen guard levels as fighter levels). The Ulfen Guard must be at least 3rd level to select this dedication.<br /><br /><em>Greater Rage (Ex)</em>: The Ulfen Guard gains greater rage; this works as the barbarian ability of the same name. The Ulfen Guard must be at least 7th level to select this dedication.<br /><br /><em>Rage Power (Ex)</em>: The Ulfen Guard can select a barbarian rage power for which she qualifies, adding her Ulfen Guard level to her barbarian level to determine access. This guard dedication can be chosen up to three times.<br /><br /><em>Teamwork (Ex)</em>: Each time she begins her rage, the Ulfen Guard can select a teamwork feat (<em>Advanced Players Guide </em>150) that her chosen ally possesses; this must be a teamwork feat for which the Ulfen Guard otherwise qualifies. For the duration of her rage, the Ulfen Guard gains the benefits of that feat. This guard dedication can be chosen multiple times; each additional time allows the Ulfen Guard to select an additional teamwork feat at the start of her rage, thus granting her the use of more than one teamwork feat simultaneously.<br /><br /><em>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</em>: The Ulfen Guard gains uncanny dodge, as the barbarian class feature of the same name. If the guard already has uncanny dodge from another source (or a previous instance of this dedication), she instead gains improved uncanny dodge. If she already has improved uncanny dodge, taking this dedication grants the effects of improved uncanny dodge to her chosen ally as long as the guard is adjacent to the ally. Use the guard&rsquo;s class level plus her barbarian levels to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank either character. This guard dedication can be chosen up to three times.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.su8CRv3Khas8Mhm2]{Rage (Ex)}<br /><strong>Rage (Ex)</strong>: An Ulfen Guard is trained to harness her brutish nature while in combat in the defense of her charge. This works as the barbarian ability of the same name. An Ulfen Guard&rsquo;s class levels stack with any other classes granting this ability for determining the effects of rage powers and the number of rounds per day the guard can rage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5GZUKheeuViri7GV]{Guarded Thoughts (Ex)}<br /><strong>Guarded Thoughts (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, if the Ulfen Guard fails a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, she immediately receives an additional save with a +5 circumstance bonus if the effect would compel her to attack her chosen ally.

In addition to utilizing their powers of mercantilism, balanced scales seek out lost, unclaimed, or wrongly seized wealth among the many tombs and ruins of the Katapesh desert. Balanced scales of Abadar develop unique powers that afford them the ability to enter dangerous areas where lost treasure can be restored to the light or hidden goods can be returned to their rightful owners. A balanced scale finds the most satisfaction in discovering long-lost treasures hidden in unmarked strongholds, owned by now nameless individuals of the past.

She adds the level of balanced scale of Abadar to the level of whatever other spellcasting class she has for the purposes of determining her caster level.<br /><br /><strong>Bypass Ward (Ex)</strong>: Ancient ruins often contain locked and sometimes warded doors; as such, a balanced scale can pick the lock of even a magically locked door (such as one sealed by <em>arcane lock</em> or <em>hold portal</em>). The Open Lock DC for the door is considered 10 higher than normal due to the effect of the warding spell. A balanced scale also gains a +2 sacred bonus to Open Lock checks. As a full-round action, a balanced scale can make an Open Lock check to disable a magical trap (such as a <em>glyph of warding</em>) for 1 minute.<br /><br /><strong>Appraising Eye (Ex)</strong>: A balanced scale must estimate value quickly and accurately, particularly when in a dangerous environment such as an underground tomb. She gains a +2 sacred bonus to all Appraise checks, and can appraise an item with 1 full-round action, instead of 1 minute, if she takes a &ndash;10 penalty.<br /><br /><strong>Bottomless Bag (Su)</strong>: Sometimes a balanced scale finds an unexpected treasure too large to transport. Once per day she can turn any ordinary sack, backpack, or other container into a <em>bag of holding type II</em>. The container remains a <em>bag of holding</em> for 1 hour per class level; after the duration expires, the container resumes its normal properties, and any items too large to fit within its true dimensions immediately and harmlessly fall out of the opening. Unlike a permanent <em>bag of holding</em>, the bag created by this ability cannot be overloaded or ruptured, nor does it have any special interaction with other kinds of extradimensional spaces.<br /><br />At 6th level, the balanced scale&rsquo;s bottomless bag increases to the size of a <em>bag of holding type III</em>. Alternately, she can create two <em>bags of holding type II</em>, though their extradimensional spaces are not linked in any way.<br /><br /><strong>Eloquent Bargainer (Ex)</strong>: Getting permission to enter treasure-laden ruins sometimes requires talking to the right people and handing around a few coins for bribes, &ldquo;finder&rsquo;s fees,&rdquo; and so on. At 4th level, a balanced scale learns which palms to grease and what promises to make, gaining a +2 bonus to Diplomacy and Gather Information checks when she offers an appropriate bribe (minimum 10 gp &times; the level of the recipient) during the interaction. In addition, she receives a +2 sacred bonus on Charisma checks made to compel a bound creature to perform a service when using the lesser <em>planar binding</em> and <em>greater planar binding</em> spells.<br /><br /><strong>Access the Vault (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a balanced scale gains the power to access the First Vault, Abadar&rsquo;s planar repository for perfect versions of every item ever made. Once per week a balanced scale can summon a copy of any one nonmagical item (normal or masterwork) as long as its market price is equal to or less than 500 gp per divine caster level and its volume is less than 1 cubic foot per caster level. The item remains with the balanced scale for 1 minute per class level, after which it returns automatically to the First Vault. Consumable items vanish once used but function for their normal duration or 1 minute per class level, whichever is less. Even if an item is destroyed while in the balanced scale&rsquo;s possession, a new copy appears in the First Vault. At 5th level, a balanced scale can use this ability to summon a magic item from the First Vault. Items with charges always arrive fully charged, and the price limit applies to this fully charged version (for example, a fully charged <em>wand of cure serious wounds</em> costs 11,250 gp, putting it out of reach of anyone caster level 22 or lower).<br /><br />Items taken from the First Vault are obviously of exceptional quality and radiate magic (even if not normally a magic item, such as a chair or table), and their unearthly perfection is enough to make any intelligent potential buyer suspicious. The church of Abadar frowns on selling items from the First Vault, as it is essentially stealing from the buyer (as the items vanish shortly thereafter), which disrupts faith in fair trade and the church; balanced scales who abuse this ability lose access to the First Vault until they have atoned for their transgression.<br /><br />Because there is only one perfect copy of each item in the First Vault, there is a remote chance (approximately 1%) that the item the character wants is unavailable because another person has borrowed it. If this happens, it does not expend the balanced scale&rsquo;s ability, and she may try again next round to summon that or another item.<br /><br />Some religious scholars theorize that this power does not actually draw items from the First Vault, as Abadar would not lend out his true perfect copies, and that the items are actually copies of the perfect items, perhaps placed in another divine vault created for this purpose or as a backup.<br /><br /><strong>Vault Jump (Sp)</strong>: Those who drive hard bargains and search for lost treasures sometimes bite off more than they can chew, and a quick exit is often the only way to escape a bad situation alive. Once per day, a balanced scale can create a one-way portal through the First Vault, which has one of two effects. First, she may use the portal as if it were a <em>dimension door</em>, but can only travel to areas within range and to which she has been (for example, she cannot use it to get past a sealed door into the unknown room beyond). Second, she may use the portal as if she were casting <em>word of recall</em>, but instead of returning to her sanctuary she always returns to the closest active temple of Abadar. The balanced scale&rsquo;s caster level for this ability is equal to her divine caster level, and she can bring others with her as defined in the spell descriptions.<br /><br />Travel through the First Vault is uncomfortable and disorienting, possibly because the Vault rejects imperfect mortal flesh in an attempt to protect itself, or because the aura of so much perfection is overwhelming to mortal senses. Regardless of the distance traveled, the balanced scale (and anyone traveling with her) arrives 1d4+1 rounds later and is nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds after arriving (Fortitude DC 15 negates).<br /><br />As with the balanced scale&rsquo;s ability to access the First Vault, some scholars believe this ability transports the user through a space other than the First Vault. Their reasoning is that, if a balanced scale were mind-controlled or otherwise compromised, this ability might allow thieves to access the First Vault and steal the priceless, perfect items stored there.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Y3wBCJrVCE75CEX2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Access the Vault (Su)","img":"icons/tools/hand/scale-balances-merchant-brown.webp","level":5,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QqJRCv71Efzu25Jg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Appraising Eye (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/hand/scale-balances-merchant-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.CcC7J9IAYk3GTJ2m","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bottomless Bag (Su)","img":"icons/tools/hand/scale-balances-merchant-brown.webp","level":3,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.30vNk6EjwOqNa9d6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bypass Ward (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/hand/scale-balances-merchant-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IIlla2YtHAgM5P9U","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eloquent Bargainer (Ex)","img":"icons/tools/hand/scale-balances-merchant-brown.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9dZ1hH5bhy1QGSr7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spellcasting","img":"icons/tools/hand/scale-balances-merchant-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.q9pqY9UiZDA0rQ0e","dataType":"compendium","name":"Vault Jump (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/hand/scale-balances-merchant-brown.webp","level":6,"_index":6}]},"tag":"balancedScaleOfAbadar","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":true,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Balanced Scale of Abadar","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The first time a pain taster performs a particular torture routine, she must spend 1 hour inflicting self-harm using materials that cost 2,000 gp. The method of self-torture is detailed in the routines below. After performing a routine for the first time, she can subsequently perform a less strenuous version of that routine to gain its benefits for 24 hours without needing to expend any further money on torture implements, ritual incense, and pain heightening drugs.<br /><br />If the pain taster wishes to change her routine, she must spend 2,000 gp when first performing the new ritual. She must pay this cost each time she changes her routine, even if returning to a routine she had previously paid for. A pain taster can benefit from only one routine at a time.<br /><br /><em>Disciple of Acuity</em>: By spending an hour reciting a lengthy series of mantras while clutching a length of razor-edged metal, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves making dozens of arterial incisions and writing the mantras in blood.<br /><br /><em>Disciple of Flexibility</em>: By spending an hour painfully hyper-extending each joint, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves tearing major tendons in each limb.<br /><br /><em>Disciple of Insight</em>: By spending an hour whipping or bludgeoning herself while meditating on her failures and regrets, a pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves inserting a long needle directly into the heart, causing massive internal hemorrhaging.<br /><br /><em>Disciple of Spirit</em>: By spending an hour splitting her tongue by cutting it centrally from the tip to the base, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves applying acid to a normally visible part of the body, inflicting extensive chemical burns.<br /><br /><em>Disciple of Torment</em>: By spending an hour eating dirt, rocks, and other indigestible matter, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves slicing open the abdominal cavity with a blade, and then sewing up the wound.<br /><br /><em>Disciple of Vigor</em>: By spending an hour hanging by the wrists from a tree, crossbeam, or any other support structure, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves breaking each rib by lying on the ground, and then repeatedly dropping a large rock directly on the ribcage.<br /><br /><strong>Masochism (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a pain taster becomes empowered by pain, and is inured to its effects. She receives a +4 class bonus on saving throws made against pain effects.<br /><br />Additionally, a pain taster can deal lethal damage to herself at any time to gain a bonus on attack and damage rolls. Doing so is a swift action that deals 2 points of damage to the pain taster, does not require an attack roll, and bypasses any damage reduction the pain taster possesses. For 1 round, the pain taster gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +2 bonus on damage rolls. Every 3 levels thereafter (4th, 7th, and 10th), the amount of damage the pain taster deals to herself increases by 2 and the resulting bonus she receives on damage rolls increase by 1 (to a maximum of 8 points of self-inflicted damage and 5 points of bonus damage to other targets at 10th level). At 7th level, the bonus on attack rolls gained when using this ability increases to +2.<br /><br /><strong>Scourge (Ex)</strong> Pain tasters are masters of torture, and at 1st level they receive Weapon Focus (whip) as a bonus feat. If the pain taster already has Weapon Focus (whip), she instead receives Whip Mastery<sup>UC</sup> as a bonus feat.<br /><br /><strong>Cruelty (Ex)</strong> At 2nd level, a pain taster gains the sneak attack ability, but only when using a whip. This additional damage stacks with any sneak attack damage she possesses from other classes. The amount of damage dealt by cruelty increases by 1d6 every 2 pain taster levels thereafter.<br /><br /><strong>Damage Reduction (Ex)</strong> At 2nd level, the pain taster&rsquo;s incredible resilience grants her a modest amount of damage reduction (DR). Subtract 1 point from the damage she is dealt by any weapon or natural attack. The pain taster&rsquo;s damage reduction increases by 1 point every 2 pain taster levels thereafter. This ability stacks with any other damage reduction the pain taster might already have from other classes. The value of this damage resistance doubles when the pain taster is subject to nonlethal damage.<br /><br /><strong>Blood Control (Ex)</strong> At 3rd level, the pain taster gains the ability to control the blood pressure throughout her body. Anytime the pain taster is dealt bleed damage, she reduces the amount of damage taken by 1 per pain taster level (minimum 0). When taking Constitution damage as a result of blood loss (such as a stirge or a vampire&rsquo;s bite), a pain taster reduces the amount of ability damage dealt by an amount equal to half the pain taster&rsquo;s class level (minimum 0).<br /><br />As an immediate action, a pain taster can delay the onset of injury or contact poisons by succeeding at a Will save. The DC of this check is equal to the poison&rsquo;s save DC. If the save is successful, the poison&rsquo;s initial and secondary damage are both delayed by 1 minute per pain taster level.<br /><br /><strong>Torturer&rsquo;s Mettle (Ex)</strong> At 3rd level, a pain taster can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to her pain taster level as a swift action. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. This ability is a swift action that can be used once per day at 3rd level and an additional time per day every 3 levels thereafter (6th and 9th).<br /><br /><strong>Pain Mastery (Ex)</strong> At 5th level, when using her masochism ability, the pain taster can combine two of her daily routines into one. The pain taster must still selfinflict the combined amount of hit point damage for both routines, though she can perform both routines simultaneously in 1 hour. When she does so, she gains the benefits from both routines (a pair of +2 enhancement bonuses). To gain access to a second routine for the first time or to change out one of the paired routines, the pain taster must still perform the new routine&rsquo;s initial torture session in full, and must pay the cost for it.<br /><br /><strong>Exquisite Lash (Ex)</strong> At 7th level, a pain taster&rsquo;s aptitude with the whip increases. She receives Whip Mastery<sup>UC</sup> as a bonus feat. If the pain taster already has Whip Mastery<sup>UC</sup>, she instead receives Improved Whip Mastery<sup>UC</sup> as a bonus feat.<br /><br /><strong>Sadism (Ex)</strong> At 9th level, a pain taster becomes worked into a frenzy when dealing damage to other targets. When she deals bonus damage to a target using her cruelty ability, she halves the number of points of damage she must self-inflict as part of her masochism ability until the end of her next turn.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QyZuFZuT98jA78iq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Masochism (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TjzOAFIvfKQ3J8yI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Scourge (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wczOFPhMwoYDwk23","dataType":"compendium","name":"Cruelty (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.W1jsLQMzncHcahim","dataType":"compendium","name":"Damage Reduction (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.udK0Mxj7VnYn22e2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Disciple of Pain (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.iWayAU0ofxlGiSw6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blood Control (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.P2qwjfZBxL8zv5S3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Torturer's Mettle (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.OnpskzWyjYsZCc0S","dataType":"compendium","name":"Pain Mastery (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":5,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.6Dz1gJG3QsrW50YB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Exquisite Lash (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":7,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.nbjwKsfnWWWh3nCD","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sadism (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blood_13.jpg","level":9,"_index":9}]},"tag":"painTaster","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":"Whips"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Yet long ago, some learned that the best way to conquer an enemy is to embrace it. These were the first shadowdancers. <br /><br />Shadowdancers exist in the boundary between light and darkness, where they weave together the shadows to become half-seen artists of deception. Unbound by any specified morality or traditional code, shadowdancers encompass a wide variety of adventuring types who have seen the value of the dark. Spellcasters use their abilities to safely cast spells from hiding and then move quickly away, while classes devoted to hand-to-hand combat enjoy the ability to attack foes with the element of surprise. Some even take the name of their kind quite literally, becoming eerie and mysterious performers and dancers, though more often the temptation presented by their talents with deception and infiltration causes shadowdancers to turn to lives of thievery. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Shadowdancers adventure for a wide variety of reasons. Many adventuring parties find shadowdancers valuable members of their teams due to their incredible stealth and ability to surprise enemies with lightning-quick attacks where they're least expected. For this reason, their services are often sought out by those groups in need of scouts or spies. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Because of their nature as visually duplicitous tricksters, shadowdancers do not fit comfortably into the lawful category, as many use their talents to avoid the eyes of legitimate authority. Yet though they are allies of darkness, shadowdancers are neither inherently evil nor predisposed to good. To them, the darkness is simply the darkness, without any of the usual moral connotations made by the unenlightened.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a shadowdancer, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Stealth 5 ranks, Perform (dance) 2 ranks. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Mobility.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Shadowdancer's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Sleight of Hand (Dex), and Stealth (Dex).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 6 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Hide in plain sight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Evasion, darkvision, uncanny dodge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Rogue talent, shadow illusion, summon shadow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Shadow call, shadow jump 40 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Defensive roll, improved uncanny dodge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Rogue talent, shadow jump 80 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Slippery mind</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Shadow jump 160 ft., shadow power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Rogue talent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.30518%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1585%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.6518%;\">Improved evasion, shadow jump 320 ft., shadow master</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />All of the following are features of the shadowdancer prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Shadowdancers are proficient with the club, crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, mace, morningstar, quarterstaff, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Shadowdancers are proficient with light armor but not with shields. <br /><br /><strong>Hide in Plain Sight (Su)</strong>: A shadowdancer can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, a shadowdancer can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow. <br /><br /><strong>Evasion (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains evasion. If exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if the shadowdancer is wearing light armor or no armor. <br /><br /><strong>Darkvision (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet. <br /><br /><strong>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. An shadowdancer with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him. <br /><br />If a shadowdancer already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead. <br /><br /><strong>Rogue Talent</strong>: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a shadowdancer gains a special ability that allows her to confound her foes. This functions as the rogue talent class feature. A shadowdancer cannot select an individual talent more than once. If a shadowdancer has the advanced talents rogue class feature, she can chose from the advanced talents list instead. <br /><br /><strong>Shadow Illusion (Sp)</strong>: When a shadowdancer reaches 3rd level, she can create visual illusions. This ability functions as <em>silent image</em>, using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A shadowdancer can use this ability once per day for every two shadowdancer levels she has attained. The DC for this ability is Charisma-based. <br /><br /><strong>Summon Shadow (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a shadow, an undead shade. Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow receives a +4 bonus on Will saves made to halve the damage from positive channeled energy and the shadow cannot be turned or commanded. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. This shadow has a number of hit points equal to half the shadowdancer's total. The shadow uses the shadowdancer's base attack bonus and base save bonuses. <br /><br />If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer gains one permanent negative level. A successful saving throw avoids this negative level. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days. <br /><br /><strong>Shadow Call (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, a shadowdancer can create creatures and effects out of raw shadow. This ability functions as <em>shadow conjuration</em>, using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A shadowdancer can use this ability once per day at 4th level, plus one additional time per day for every two levels attained beyond 4th (2/day at 6th level, 3/day at 8th level, and 4/day at 10th level). Upon reaching 10th level, this ability functions as <em>greater shadow conjuration</em>. The DC for this ability is Charisma-based. <br /><br /><strong>Shadow Jump (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a <em>dimension door </em>spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some dim light. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 40 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 40 feet or four jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (80 feet at 6th, 160 feet at 8th, and 320 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment. <br /><br /><strong>Defensive Roll (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 5th level, once per day, a shadowdancer can attempt to avoid a lethal blow. This functions as the rogue's advanced talent of the same name. <br /><br /><strong>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level and higher, shadowdancer can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the assassin by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has assassin levels. <br /><br />If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character. <br /><br /><strong>Slippery Mind (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a shadowdancer becomes resilient to enchantment spells. This functions as the rogue's advanced talent of the same name. <br /><br /><strong>Shadow Power (Sp)</strong>: At 8th level, a shadowdancer can use raw shadow to damage her foes. This ability functions as <em>shadow evocation</em>, using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A shadowdancer can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and one additional time per day upon reaching 10th level. The DC for this ability is Charisma-based. <br /><br /><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex)</strong>: This ability, gained at 10th level, works like evasion (see above).

he accumulates scars of supernatural significance. He can activate his enduring scars abilities in any combination a number of times per day equal to half his class level plus his Charisma modifier. At 1st level and every 2 class levels thereafter, the scar seeker awakens a new enduring scar selected from the list below.<br /><br /><em>Blood</em>: As a swift action, the scar seeker can imbue a melee weapon he wields with the <em>vicious</em> weapon special ability for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). At 5th level, he can select this scar a second time to increase the extra damage to 2d8 and the damage received to 1d8. At 9th level, he can select the scar a third time to increase the extra damage to 2d10 and damage received to 1d10.<br /><br /><em>Healing</em>: When the scar seeker uses his lay on hands ability to heal another creature, the scar seeker can use this scar to heal double the normal amount of damage; however, the scar seeker immediately takes damage equal to half the amount he healed, and this damage cannot be reduced or otherwise prevented in any way.<br /><br /><em>Martyr</em>: When the scar seeker is brought below 0 hit points, he can expend all his remaining uses of lay on hands (minimum 1) as an immediate action in order to heal his allies and harm evil enemies in a 30-foot radius. He restores or deals an amount of damage equal to 4d6 plus his level, and the damage increases by 1d6 for each use of lay on hands he expends; a creature takes half damage if it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + the scar seeker&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier). The damage dealt by this ability comes from holy power and is not subject to damage reduction, energy immunities, or any energy resistances. The scar seeker must be 5th level in order to select this scar.<br /><br /><em>Mercy</em>: When the scar seeker uses his lay on hands ability, he can use this scar to apply the benefits of a paladin mercy he doesn&rsquo;t have but for which he qualifies. A scar seeker&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels in any other class that grants the mercy ability. The scar seeker must be 3rd level to select this scar.<br /><br /><em>Sacrifice</em>: As an immediate action, the scar seeker can share the damage taken by one ally he can see within 30 feet. This functions as per shield other, but lasts only until the end of his next turn or until his ally moves farther than 30 feet from the scar seeker. The scar seeker must be 3rd level to select this scar.<br /><br /><em>Suffering</em>: As a swift action, the scar seeker&rsquo;s skin and nerves harden until the beginning of his next turn, granting him DR 2/&mdash; and a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with the emotion<sup>UM</sup> or fear descriptor. At 7th level, he can select this scar a second time to increase the damage reduction and saving throw bonus to half his class level.<br /><br /><em>Tenacity</em>: When a scar seeker is struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, the scar seeker can gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier as an immediate action. If the scar seeker already receives a morale bonus on one or more of these rolls, the morale bonus increases by 1 while this ability lasts.<br /><br /><strong>Painful Purification (Su)</strong>: A scar seeker can relive his past sacrifices in order to activate an enduring scar&rsquo;s ability, even if he has expended all his daily uses of the ability. Rather than expend a daily use of enduring scars, he can activate a scar by taking 1 point of damage per Hit Die he has. This damage can&rsquo;t be healed by any means other than getting a full night&rsquo;s rest, which removes all damage dealt in this fashion. This damage cannot be ignored, reduced, or redirected.<br /><br /><strong>Lay on Hands (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a scar seeker gains the ability to lay on hands. This ability functions as the paladin ability of the same name. For the purpose of this ability, a scar seeker&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels in any other class that grants the lay on hands ability. <br /><br /><strong>Smite Evil (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a scar seeker gains the ability to smite evil. This ability functions like the paladin ability of the same name, but the scar seeker&rsquo;s effective paladin level equals his class level &ndash; 3 (minimum 1). For the purpose of this ability, a scar seeker&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels in any other class that grants the smite evil ability. He gains another use per day of this ability at 8th level.<br /><br /><strong>Sanguine Sacrifice (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, when a scar seeker uses the painful purification ability, he gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 hour. Multiple uses of this ability increase the morale bonus by 1 (maximum one-third his class level).<br /><br /><strong>True Martyr (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a scar seeker can embrace death in a final act of defiance. As an immediate action, he can take half the damage dealt to all allies within 60 feet by a single effect, such as a breath weapon, melee attack, or cave-in. If this damage would kill the scar seeker, his blood coalesces in his space in the form of a lawful good monadic deva (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 27</em>) that fights in his place for 1 minute before dissipating. A scar seeker can use this ability once per week.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.J2q6ZzQy1lXpsXBq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Enduring Scar (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_21.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.stEYdjHdJGA09jAp","dataType":"compendium","name":"Lay on Hands (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_21.jpg","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TK2Gn3rsbde0FqhW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Painful Purification (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_21.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.RfI1XamDv8W2xaCB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sanguine Sacrifice (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_21.jpg","level":5,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.c3KlrMsVeh5cXsqa","dataType":"compendium","name":"Smite Evil (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_21.jpg","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ZdW9QXCOtKK7mUwW","dataType":"compendium","name":"True Martyr (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_21.jpg","level":10,"_index":5}]},"tag":"scarSeeker","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They are the chosen of the gods, and they often hold status nearly equal to that of a chief or shaman in a typical tribe, or sometimes even exceeding this. Rage prophets can dispense advice through their communion with the spirits and ability to divine the future. <br /><br />Rage prophets are always barbarian/oracles, though some have levels in other classes as well. The most popular oracle mystery among rage prophets is that of battle, for skill in battle is respected in barbarian society, but oracles of all mysteries find their way into positions as war-chiefs, counselors, and leaders. Some rage prophets choose to live apart or to act as wandering champions, belonging to all tribes and none, following the lead of their spirit guides rather than the dictates of any one tribal chief or council. Though sometimes looked at askance by tribal leaders, these wanderers are popular with many barbarians, who see them as the perfect exemplars of the strength, virtue, and power of the free folk, owing nothing to anyone but the sky above, the earth beneath, and the spirits within. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: The rage prophet has considerable spellcasting ability, but it usually serves as a conduit to enhance his fighting prowess. His combat skills are considerable and his ability to keep himself going in any fight and to focus his physical rage into supernatural power gives him an unexpected boost in power and versatility to overcome any challenge. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Rage prophets may be of any nonlawful alignment, but chaotic alignments are more common, as they are in the barbarian tribes from which they hail. Wandering rage prophets are usually chaotic, living apart from any tribe and the tribal structure of their heritage as they take up the adventuring life.</span></p>\n<h2

proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a rage prophet gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous caster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If he had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a rage prophet, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Savage Seer</strong>: A rage prophet's class level stacks with barbarian levels for determining the effect of rage powers, and with oracle levels for determining the effect of oracle revelations and his oracle's curse. This does not grant additional abilities. <br /><br /><strong>Spirit Guide (Sp)</strong>: Every rage prophet possesses a spirit guide, an insubstantial phantom that speaks to his mind, watches over him, and lends him its strength and wisdom. Whenever the rage prophet rages, he gains the benefit of a single guidance spell from his spirit guide; this bonus can be used at any time during his rage. The spirit guide also allows the rage prophet to use <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>ghost sound</em>, and <em>mage hand </em>as spell-like abilities once per day each (caster level equal to the rage prophet's class level). The DCs are Charisma-based. <br /><br /><strong>Rage Prophet Mystery</strong>: At 2nd level and every even level thereafter, a rage prophet learns an additional spell from his spirit guide. These spells are in addition to those listed in Table 2-6: Oracle Spells Known. Like spells from an oracle's mystery, the rage prophet cannot exchange these spells for different spells at higher levels. The rage prophet must be able to cast oracle spells of the listed level to learn one of these spells from his spirit guide. The rage prophet treats the spell as an oracle spell of the listed level. The possible spells are <em>arcane eye </em>(4th), <em>augury </em>(2nd), <em>divination </em>(4th), <em>dream </em>(5th), <em>find the path </em>(6th), <em>helping hand </em>(3rd), <em>see invisibility </em>(2nd), <em>shadow walk </em>(6th), <em>speak with dead </em>(3rd), <em>spectral hand </em>(2nd), <em>spiritual weapon </em>(2nd), <em>unseen servant </em>(1st), <em>vision </em>(7th), and <em>whispering wind </em>(2nd). <br /><br /><strong>Raging Healer (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a rage prophet is able to cast <em>cure </em>spells on himself while raging, without having to use clarity of mind. <br /><br /><strong>Indomitable Caster (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a rage prophet adds his Constitution bonus (if any) on concentration checks. <br /><br /><strong>Ragecaster (Su)</strong>: Starting at 4th level, a rage prophet's spells grow more potent when he rages. When using moment of clarity, he adds his barbarian level to his caster level. At 7th level, he adds his Constitution bonus to the save DC of any spells cast while raging. <br /><br /><strong>Spirit Guardian (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, the competence bonus provided by the spirit guide's <em>guidance </em>spell increases to half the rage prophet's class level when used while battling a fey, outsider, undead, or incorporeal creature. As a swift action, the rage prophet can spend 1 round of rage (whether he is raging or not) to give his armor and weapons the <em>ghost touch </em>property for 1 round; this effect ends if the item is no longer in his possession. <br /><br /><strong>Enduring Rage (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, as a free action, a rage prophet can extend the duration of his rage by sacrificing a spell slot; this prolongs the duration of his rage for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot used. <br /><br /><strong>Raging Spellstrength (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a rage prophet is able to cast spells with a range of &ldquo;personal&rdquo; on himself while raging, without having to use clarity of mind. <br /><br /><strong>Spirit Warrior (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, the competence bonus provided by the rage prophet's <em>guidance </em>increases to his rage prophet level when used while battling a fey, outsider, undead, or incorporeal creature. His ability to give his armor and weapons the <em>ghost touch </em>property becomes an immediate action instead of a swift action. <br /><br /><strong>Greater Rage (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, when a rage prophet enters a rage, his morale bonus to Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.juPAojWyib7xeza2","dataType":"compendium","name":"Savage Seer","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YXpXSnMQFbPqAO7Q","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spirit Guide (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.r6riOGtLIltBHLPL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Rage Prophet Mystery","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ygpoYJ9nc2hejgub","dataType":"compendium","name":"Raging Healer (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.nMb7IrY2XtYUTRRW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Indomitable Caster (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4baFpTINFk9TIFzF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ragecaster (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.43MCZN707bshYtTu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spirit Guardian (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":5,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Wl2U58dKZvo9YlFA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Enduring Rage (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":6,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8JjuCdtOFECbbZh5","dataType":"compendium","name":"Raging Spellstrength (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":8,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.uyad3l4AqVyjT3tO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Spirit Warrior (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":9,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5TxXVRYBHA8N3rfl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Rage (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/deafening-critical.jpg","level":10,"_index":10}]},"tag":"rageProphet","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Horizon walkers are masters of travel, always seeking to find the safe ways through inhospitable terrain. They are comfortable in places others speak of only in hushed whispers, and they can both venture forth onto untrod paths themselves and guide the less-traveled through such hazardous lands.<br /><br />Though rangers are most likely to be attracted to the ever-wandering life common to horizon walkers, barbarians, fighters, and rogues have also been known to find it appealing. Horizon walkers are most common in areas on the edge of civilization, where they can easily spend time away from the known and boring streets of settled lands.<br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Horizon walkers have the accuracy and resilience to face frontline combat. They also have the skills and abilities to make excellent scouts, often taking the role of the first member of a group into danger and the last one out. Of course, walkers shine when adventuring in areas that match their many favored terrains, but many of the tricks they pick up in specific regions have application in a wide range of situations, allowing a horizon walker to be more mobile and resourceful than typical combatants.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Anyone can crave new vistas and constant travel, and thus a horizon walker can be of any alignment.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a horizon walker, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (geography) 6 ranks.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Endurance.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Horizon Walker's class skills are Climb (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 6 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Favored terrain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Favored terrain, terrain mastery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Terrain dominance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Favored terrain, terrain mastery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Favored terrain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Terrain dominance, terrain mastery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Favored terrain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Favored terrain, terrain mastery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Terrain dominance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.8646%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.2235%;\">Favored terrain, master of all lands</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the horizon walker prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A horizon walker gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Favored Terrain</strong>: At 1st level, a horizon walker may select a favored terrain from the ranger Favored Terrains table (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>65). This works exactly like the ranger favored terrain ability. The horizon walker gains an additional favored terrain at 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 10th level, and he can increase the bonus from an existing favored terrain as described in the ranger ability. If the horizon walker has abilities from other classes that only work in a favored terrain (such as a ranger's camouflage and hide in plain sight abilities), those abilities work in favored terrains selected as a horizon walker. <br /><br /><strong>Terrain Mastery</strong>: At 2nd level, a horizon walker selects a favored terrain to master. When within this terrain the horizon walker may, as a move action, grant a +2 bonus on Climb, Stealth, Perception and Survival checks made by all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The character masters one additional terrain at 4th, 6th, and 8th levels. <br /><br />Mastery of each terrain has additional benefits, outlined below; these benefits apply to the horizon walker at all times whether or not he is in the relevant terrain. <br /><br /><em>Astral Plane</em>: The horizon walker's fly speed increases by +30 feet on planes with no gravity or subjective gravity. <br /><em>Cold</em>: The horizon walker gains cold resistance 10. <br /><em>Desert</em>: The horizon walker gains immunity to exhaustion; anything that would cause him to become exhausted makes him fatigued instead. <br /><em>Ethereal Plane</em>: The horizon walker ignores the 20% concealment miss chance from fog and mist, and treats total concealment from these sources as concealment. <br /><em>Forest</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks. <br /><em>Jungle</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks and increases his CMD against grapple maneuvers by +4. <br /><em>Mountain</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks and does not lose his Dexterity modifier to AC while climbing. <br /><em>Plains</em>: The horizon walker's movement is not reduced by wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load. <br /><em>Plane of Air</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Fly checks and +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against flying creatures. He gains the ability to breathe air if he cannot already do so. <br /><em>Plane of Earth</em>: The horizon walker gains DR 1/adamantine. <br /><em>Plane of Fire</em>: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 10. <br /><em>Plane of Water</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against swimming creatures. He gains the ability to breathe water if he cannot already do so. <br /><em>Plane, aligned</em>: If the horizon walker selects a plane with an alignment trait, he can choose to detect as that alignment (fooling all forms of magic divination) as an immediate action; this benefit lasts until he dismisses it (a free action). <br /><em>Swamp</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks. <br /><em>Underground</em>: The horizon walker gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat. <br /><em>Urban</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks. <br /><em>Water</em>: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against swimming creatures. <br /><br /><strong>Terrain Dominance</strong>: At 3rd level, a horizon walker learns total dominance over one terrain he has already selected for terrain mastery. When dealing with creatures native to that terrain, the horizon walker treats his favored terrain bonus for that terrain as a favored enemy bonus (as the ranger class feature) against those creatures.This bonus overlaps (does not stack with) bonuses gained when fighting a favored enemy. <br /><br />Each terrain dominance grants additional abilities, detailed below. When the horizon walker gains a new terrain dominance he may, if he prefers, instead pick an additional terrain mastery. <br /><br /><em>Astral Plane</em>: The horizon walker gains a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders. He gains <em>dimension door </em>as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). <br /><em>Cold</em>: The horizon walker gains cold resistance 20 (this replaces the character's cold resistance from mastery of the cold terrain) and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against creatures of the cold subtype. <br /><em>Desert</em>: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 10 and immunity to fatigue. <br /><em>Ethereal Plane</em>: The walker gains <em>ethereal jaunt </em>as a spell-like ability once per day (caster level equal to the character's level). He must be at least 7th level before selecting this power. <br /><em>Forest</em>: The horizon walker gains <em>hallucinatory terrain </em>as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). The horizon walker can only use this ability to create illusory forests. <br /><em>Jungle</em>: The horizon walker gains <em>charm monster </em>as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). This charm only affects animals, magical beasts, and creatures primarily found in the jungle. <br /><em>Mountain</em>: The horizon walker gains DR 2/adamantine. <br /><em>Plains</em>: The walker's base speed increases by +10 feet. <br /><em>Plane of Air</em>: The horizon walker gains <em>fly </em>as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). <br /><em>Plane of Earth</em>: The horizon walker gains tremorsense with a range of 30 feet. He must be at least 5th level before selecting this plane for this ability. <br /><em>Plane of Fire</em>: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 20 (this replaces the character's file resistance from mastery of the Plane of Fire terrain) and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls again creatures of the fire subtype. <br /><em>Plane of Water</em>: The horizon walker's movements and actions are not hampered when underwater. This allows him to speak, make attacks, and cast spells normally underwater (as if using <em>freedom of movement</em>). <br /><em>Plane, aligned</em>: For the purpose of bypassing damage reduction, the horizon walker's manufactured and natural weapons count as the opposite alignment of his chosen plane of dominance. If his chosen plane has more than one alignment type, he must choose one of those types for this ability. For example, if he selects &ldquo;Hell&rdquo; (an evil, lawful plane) for his terrain dominance ability, he may choose &ldquo;evil&rdquo; or &ldquo;lawful,&rdquo; which means his attacks bypass good or chaotic damage reduction, respectively. Alternatively, if native creatures of his chosen plane are vulnerable to a particular special material (such as cold iron or silver), he may choose to have his weapons bypass damage reduction as if they were that special material. If he selects this plane more than once for his terrain dominance ability, his attacks count as an additional alignment or special material (such as &ldquo;good and silver&rdquo; or &ldquo;chaotic and good&rdquo;). <br /><em>Swamp</em>: The horizon walker gains tremorsense with a 30-foot range. He must be 5th level before selecting this power. <br /><em>Underground</em>: The horizon walker gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If he already has darkvision 60 feet, its range extends by 60 feet. <br /><em>Urban</em>: The horizon walker gains <em>charm person </em>as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). <br /><em>Water</em>: The horizon walker gains a swim speed of 20 feet. If he already has a natural swim speed, his swim speed increases by +20 feet. <br /><br /><strong>Master of All Lands (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, the horizon walker becomes familiar with and comfortable in all possible terrains.

They conduct both overt and discreet investigations of crimes within Alkenstar, as well as events elsewhere in the world that might threaten Alkenstar&rsquo;s monopolistic domination of the gun trade. Smuggling, industrial espionage, and sabotage greatly concern the Ironmaster and Alkenstar&rsquo;s ruling parliament, and the shieldmarshals are their chief weapon to combat such felonious behavior. The sheer skill with which they wield their favored firearms makes shieldmarshals a force to be reckoned with, and their silver crossed-rifle shield-badges are enough to open virtually any door in the Grand Duchy and to hold any citizen to account.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a shieldmarshal, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Gunsmithing, Quick Draw.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Diplomacy 5 ranks, Intimidate 5 ranks, Knowledge (local) 5 ranks, Perception 5 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Must have a grit pool of at least 1 grit point and proficiency with at least two firearms.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Shieldmarshal's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), and Survival (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Eye for detail, legal judgment 1/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Danger sense, gunmarshal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Labyrinthine cunning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Legal judgment 2/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Urban commando</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Gunhunter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Legal judgment 3/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Double jeopardy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">Quarry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.8821%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.1886%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.2421%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.12477%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1341%;\">High shieldmarshal, legal judgment 4/day</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the shieldmarshal prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A shieldmarshal gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Eye for Detail (Ex)</strong>: A shieldmarshal adds his Intelligence bonus as well as his Wisdom bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks. In addition, he gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his level on Perception checks opposed by another creature&rsquo;s Disguise or Sleight of Hand checks.<br /><br /><strong>Legal Judgment (Ex)</strong>: A shieldmarshal can pronounce legal judgment upon his foes as a swift action, providing a bonus or ability based on the type of judgment made. Once activated, the ability lasts until the combat ends. If the shieldmarshal is dazed, frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to participate in combat, the effect does not end but provides no benefit until he is again able to participate in combat. As a swift action, the shieldmarshal can change his legal judgment to another type.<br /><br />This ability can be used once per day, plus once for every three levels beyond 1st. It is equivalent to an inquisitor&rsquo;s judgment ability for the purpose of feats, magic items, or other game effects that affect the judgment ability; however, levels in the two classes do not stack.<br /><br /><em>Bulletproof</em>: A shieldmarshal gains DR 1/&mdash; against ranged attacks. Starting at 4th level, this DR is equal to 1/2 the shieldmarshal&rsquo;s class level. A shieldmarshal must be wearing armor or using a shield to use this judgment.<br /><br /><em>Destruction</em>: A shieldmarshal gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls with firearms or light blades, increasing to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 10th level. This bonus is doubled on critical hit confirmation rolls.<br /><br /><em>Evasive</em>: A shieldmarshal gains the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge abilities as a rogue of her class level. If he possesses rogue levels, these levels stack.<br /><br /><em>Justice</em>: A shieldmarshal gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls with firearms or light blades. Starting at 4th level, this bonus is equal to 1/2 the shieldmarshal&rsquo;s class level.<br /><br /><em>Lucky Dodge</em>: A shieldmarshal gains a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class, increasing to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 10th level. This bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against him.<br /><br /><em>Quick Recovery</em>: A shieldmarshal recovers quickly from injury, gaining fast healing 1, increasing to fast healing 2 at 5th level and fast healing 3 at 10th level.<br /><br /><em>Sharpshooter</em>: A shieldmarshal ignores 1 point of any AC bonus granted by cover per shieldmarshal level. This does not allow the shieldmarshal to ignore total cover.<br /><br /><em>Sure Shot</em>: A shieldmarshal reduces his miss chance with firearms due to concealment, <em>blink</em>, <em>blur</em>, or similar effects by 5% per two shieldmarshal levels (to a maximum reduction of 25% at 10th level). He must still target the correct square to hit a creature with concealment. This judgment can&rsquo;t decrease his miss chance to lower than 0%.<br /><br /><strong>Danger Sense (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a shieldmarshal gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 his level, and can always act during a surprise round even if unaware of opponents.<br /><br /><strong>Gunmarshal (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 2nd level, a shieldmarshal gains deeds as a gunslinger of half his level. If he also has gunslinger levels, these levels stack. In addition, within the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, he gains a bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks equal to 1/2 his shieldmarshal level if he openly displays his shieldmarshal&rsquo;s badge.<br /><br /><strong>Labyrinthine Cunning (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a shieldmarshal never becomes lost in urban terrain, and he never takes penalties to movement for poor visibility in urban terrain, even while temporarily blinded. A shieldmarshal can open or close doors as a swift action instead of a move action.<br /><br /><strong>Urban Commando (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a shieldmarshal treats urban areas as his favored terrain, as the ranger class feature. At 10th level, his favored terrain bonus increases to +4 but he does not gain a second favored terrain. If he already has a favored terrain bonus in urban terrain from another class, these bonuses stack but do not affect bonuses in other terrain types.<br /><br /><strong>Gunhunter (Ex)</strong>: A shieldmarshal is well versed in covert operations, especially in urban settings. At 6th level, the shieldmarshal can move through crowds and difficult terrain without impediment in urban terrain. He can use Stealth to hide in urban terrain even without cover or concealment; if he has cover or concealment, he gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to 1/2 his class level.<br /><br /><strong>Double Jeopardy (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, whenever a shieldmarshal uses his legal judgment ability, he selects two different judgments, instead of one. This consumes only one use of his legal judgment ability. As a swift action, he can change one of these effects to another type.<br /><br /><strong>Quarry (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a shieldmarshal can declare one target within his line of sight as his quarry. This ability functions exactly like the ranger ability of the same name.<br /><br /><strong>High Shieldmarshal (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a shieldmarshal attains the highest rank among his order. He can expend one use of his legal judgment ability to create a nonmagical effect equivalent to <em>discern lies </em>(caster level equal to his class level; DC = 20 + the shieldmarshal&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier), or expend one use as part of an initiative check or Charisma-based skill check to take 20 on that check.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.QsDvIB5mfC5c9DKG","dataType":"compendium","name":"Danger Sense (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EYSkKzo92F6sas21","dataType":"compendium","name":"Double Jeopardy (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":8,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.X0cBoKchAsSVfgwJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eye for Detail (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wiNqDlELVgIdt4MS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Gunhunter (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":6,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gNIhgXDhQOnOqjwj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Gunmarshal (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.bCuBBGRW4pqZAumk","dataType":"compendium","name":"High Shieldmarshal (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":10,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Y9LSWuESrJ8LXpEf","dataType":"compendium","name":"Legal Judgment (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":4,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FN1eFKHegwVJGcvc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Quarry (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":9,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vF8YL84Tsj2jzuMT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Urban Commando (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":5,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1SncOV5gCa5hmlDw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Labyrinthine Cunning (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/armor/shield-heavy-wood.png","level":3,"_index":9}]},"tag":"shieldmarshal","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":true,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

That character cannot attempt to resurrect the souldrinker again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do. This vow also grants the souldrinker a +3 bonus on saving throws against death effects and negative energy, which stacks with other such bonuses.<br /><br /><strong> Cacodaemon Familiar (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, the souldrinker gains a cacodaemon familiar, as if she had the Improved Familiar feat. If the souldrinker already has a familiar, the cacodaemon replaces that familiar by devouring the prior familiar (this does not penalize the souldrinker). The souldrinker counts as an evil outsider for the purpose of using soul gems created by a cacodaemon.<br /><br /><strong> Obedience (Ex)</strong>: In order to maintain her souldrinker abilities (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by this prestige class), a souldrinker must indulge the Horseman or harbinger she worships with a daily obedience. This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the souldrinker uses to regain spellcasting abilities (such as meditating, praying to a demigod, or studying a spellbook). When a character takes her first level of souldrinker, she must decide whether she is an evangelist, an exalted, or a sentinel of her daemonic patron. This choice determines which category of boons she earns as she gains levels, and once made, it cannot later be changed.<br /><br /><strong> Enervation (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, a souldrinker can cast <em>enervation</em> twice per day as a spell-like ability (CL = her character level). At 5th level, she can use this ability four times per day, and at 8th level, she can use it six times per day.<br /><br /><strong> Soul Pool (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a souldrinker can store stolen life energy to use thereafter to accomplish unnatural feats. Her soul pool starts at 0, and at any one time, it can contain a maximum number of soul points equal to her souldrinker level. Every time a souldrinker inflicts a negative level on a creature other than herself, she gains 1 soul point. A souldrinker can expend soul points for the following.<br /><br /><em>Create Item</em>: A souldrinker can expend points from her soul pool to provide energy for the creation of magic items. Each point expended provides 500 gp worth of raw materials for the item.<br /><br /><em>Recover Spell Slot</em>: As a full-round action, a souldrinker can expend a number of points from her soul pool equal to double the spell level of a cast spell or expended spell slot in order to regain that spell or slot as if it had not been used. <em>Protect Soul</em>: A souldrinker can spend soul points to avoid gaining a negative level, at a rate of 1 soul point per negative level negated.<br /><br /><strong>Daemonic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su)</strong>: As a souldrinker gains levels, she gains boons from her patron as her body and soul become increasingly infused with daemonic energies. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the souldrinker&rsquo;s chosen patron and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each Horseman or harbinger grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the souldrinker gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the Horseman and harbinger descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a souldrinker boon grants a spell-like ability, her caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a souldrinker to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally. <strong>Lesser Oblivion (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a souldrinker&rsquo;s apocalyptic vow invests her with a specific ability, depending on which Horseman she made her vow to, as listed below:<br /><br /><em>Apollyon</em>: Immunity to diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.<br /><em>Charon</em>: Immunity to aging effects and Constitution damage and drain.<br /><em>Szuriel</em>: Immunity to bleed effects and Strength damage and drain.<br /><em>Trelmarixian</em>: Immunity to ingested and inhaled poisons, and the souldrinker no longer needs to eat or drink.<br /><br /><strong>Oblivion (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, the souldrinker is granted more power by her apocalyptic vow, gaining a spell-like ability usable at will but that costs 1 soul point for each use.<br /><br /><em>Apollyon</em>: <em>contagion<br /><em>Charon</em>: <em>vampiric touch<br /><em>Szuriel</em>: <em>rage<br /><em>Trelmarixian</em>: <em>bestow curse<br /><br /><strong>Greater Oblivion (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, the souldrinker gains more power from her apocalyptic vow. The spell-like abilities listed here are usable at will but cost 3 soul points per use. <em>Apollyon</em>: <em>plague storm</em><br /><em>Charon</em>: <em>wither limb</em><br /><em>Szuriel</em>: <em>blade barrier</em><br /><em>Trelmarixian</em>: quickened <em>feast of ashes</em>&nbsp;</em></em></em></em></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mKu2EKf5CzQtyagr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Apocalyptic Vow (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1nWJvJhpbJ1Pn42F","dataType":"compendium","name":"Cacodaemon Familiar (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TCMRky74nZmVhf7Z","dataType":"compendium","name":"Daemonic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":3,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mMt5L8PmgkhviG3G","dataType":"compendium","name":"Enervation (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Y53tkxosp8VExfLo","dataType":"compendium","name":"Obedience (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.45INrjD2PAcXTKXU","dataType":"compendium","name":"Soul Pool (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SJFUxcy21JT4W1Aa","dataType":"compendium","name":"Oblivion (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":7,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cxiidD3RC7PNeEoI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Lesser Oblivion (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":4,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5RH7tNqfc7mGnuj9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Oblivion (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/command-undead.png","level":10,"_index":8}]},"tag":"souldrinker","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"favored weapon of her daemonic patron"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Some give offerings to many divinities in hopes of appeasing them all, while others serve one faithfully and exclusively, even zealously. A few, however, are instead chosen by their deities to fulfill sacred missions. Some are merely graced with the anointing spirit of divinity, while a few are the literal scions of their divine patrons, by-blows of a dalliance with mortals. Whatever the source, these are the few who can, with the proper training, become divine scions. The spark of divinity animates their every deed, and voices whisper secrets and commands that were never meant for the ears of others. Divine scions may frustrate the orthodox hierarchy of their faith, as they represent an end-run around the ecclesiastical structures of the church. Their calling comes directly from their deity, and their orders supersede any earthly authority. Of course, many more claim such direct visitation and commission than actually have been touched by the divine, but it is risky to defy or deny any who claim it.</span></p>\n<h2

additional weapon or armor proficiencies. She can select Greater Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, and Greater Weapon Specialization as feats once she qualifies for them normally (although she does not have to fulfill the prerequisite of having fighter levels in order to select these feats).<br /><br /><strong>Spells</strong>: When a divine scion gains a level, she gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benef its a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of divine scion to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class she has.<br /><br />If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before she became a divine scion, she must choose which class she adds each divine scion level to for the purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Opposition Alignment (Ex)</strong>: A divine scion must pick one of the following alignment subtypes as her opposition alignment: chaotic, evil, good, or law. The opposition alignment she chooses must be one that she does not possess as part of her own alignment. She gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance of creatures with that alignment subtype.<br /><br /><strong>Domain Specialization (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a divine scion selects a domain granted by her deity&mdash;this domain becomes the divine scion&rsquo;s chosen specialization in representing her deity. Although most divine scions pick domains that they&rsquo;ve gained from other classes (such as cleric), they don&rsquo;t have to do so. Every time a divine scion casts a domain spell from her specialized domain, she heals damage equal to twice the spell&rsquo;s level.<br /><br />In addition, each domain specialization grants a spell-like ability (which functions at a caster level equal to the divine scion&rsquo;s total character level) and a permanent sacred bonus (or profane, if the divine scion is evil) on a single type of d20 roll. The specific spell-like abilities and bonuses granted are listed below. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) are detailed in the <em>Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide</em>, while spells marked with two asterisks (**) are detailed in <em>Ultimate Magic</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Air</strong>: <em>fly </em>1/day; +4 on Fly checks<br /><strong>Animal</strong>: <em>beast shape I</em> 1/day; +4 on Handle Animal checks<br /><strong>Artifice</strong>: <em>crafter&rsquo;s fortune</em>* 3/day; +4 on Craft checks<br /><strong>Chaos</strong>: <em>detect law </em>constant ; +2 on Will saves<br /><strong>Charm</strong>: <em>beguiling gift</em>* 3/day; +4 on Diplomacy checks<br /><strong>Community</strong>: <em>tongues </em>1/day; +4 on Diplomacy checks<br /><strong>Darkness</strong>: <em>shadow weapon</em>** 3/day; +4 on Perception checks<br /><strong>Death</strong>: <em>murderous command</em>** 3/day; +2 on Fortitude saves<br /><strong>Destruction</strong>: <em>break</em>* 3/day; +4 on Intimidate checks<br /><strong>Earth</strong>: <em>stone fist</em>* 3/day; +4 on Survival checks<br /><strong>Evil</strong>: <em>detect good </em>constant; +2 on Will saves<br /><strong>Fire</strong>: <em>flame arrow </em>1/day; +4 on Acrobatics checks<br /><strong>Glory</strong>: <em>archon&rsquo;s aura</em>** 1/day; +4 on Intimidate checks<br /><strong>Good</strong>: <em>detect evil </em>constant; +2 on Will saves<br /><strong>Healing</strong>: <em>symbol of healing</em>** 1/day; +4 on Heal checks<br /><strong>Knowledge</strong>: <em>identify </em>3/day; +4 on Knowledge checks (choose one)<br /><strong>Law</strong>: <em>detect chaos </em>constant; +2 on Will saves<br /><strong>Liberation</strong>: <em>remove sickness</em>** 3/day; +4 on Escape Artist checks<br /><strong>Luck</strong>: <em>divine favor </em>3/day; +2 on Reflex saves<br /><strong>Madness</strong>: <em>fumbletongue</em>** 3/day; +4 on Bluff checks<br /><strong>Magic</strong>: <em>detect magic </em>constant; +4 on Spellcraft checks<br /><strong>Nobility</strong>: <em>command </em>1/day; +4 on Diplomacy checks<br /><strong>Plant</strong>: <em>speak with plants </em>1/day; +2 on Fortitude saves<br /><strong>Protection</strong>: <em>wrathful mantle</em>* 1/day; +1 to Armor Class<br /><strong>Repose</strong>: <em>sanctify corpse </em>3/day; +2 on Fortitude saves<br /><strong>Rune</strong>: <em>comprehend languages </em>3/day; +4 on Linguistics checks<br /><strong>Scalykind</strong>: <em>summon nature&rsquo;s ally III </em>(reptilian creatures only), 1/day; +2 on Reflex saves<br /><strong>Strength</strong>: <em>burst bonds</em>* 3/day; +4 on combat maneuver checks<br /><strong>Sun</strong>: <em>daylight </em>1/day; +4 on Perception checks<br /><strong>Travel</strong>: <em>expeditious retreat </em>3/day; +4 on Acrobatics checks<br /><strong>Trickery</strong>: <em>glibness </em>1/day; +4 on Stealth checks<br /><strong>Void</strong>: <em>deeper darkness </em>1/day; +4 on concentration checks<br /><strong>War</strong>: <em>true strike </em>3/day; +1 on weapon damage rolls<br /><strong>Water</strong>: <em>water walk </em>1/day; +4 on Swim checks<br /><strong>Weather</strong>: <em>cloak of winds</em>* 1/day; +4 on Survival checks<br /><br /><strong>Divine Wrath (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a divine scion&rsquo;s damaging spells deal +1 point of damage per die against creatures with an alignment subtype that matches the divine scion&rsquo;s opposition alignment.<br /><br /><strong>Deific Defense (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a divine scion gains DR 2, bypassed by attacks with the alignment subtype of her opposition alignment (so a divine scion with &ldquo;evil&rdquo; as her opposition alignment gains DR 2/evil).<br /><br /><strong>Divine Awe (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a divine scion&rsquo;s spells can stagger creatures that match the alignment subtypes of the divine scion&rsquo;s opposition alignment. When such a creature is affected by a divine scion&rsquo;s spell, it is staggered for 1 round if it fails its save against that spell. If the creature makes its save (or if the spell doesn&rsquo;t allow a saving throw), this ability has no effect.<br /><br /><strong>True Scion</strong>: At 10th level, a divine scion becomes a true scion of her deity. The amount of healing she gains from her domain specialization doubles. Her divine wrath ability now deals +2 points of damage per die against creatures of the appropriate alignment. The damage reduction granted by her deific defense increases to 5. Finally, she permanently increases her Wisdom or Charisma score (her choice) by +1.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8L3rsC547OugACaA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deific Defense (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_06.jpg","level":7,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.m46yFGVCLOTcQK75","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Awe (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_06.jpg","level":8,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5zHKRoNICJWDDGu9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Wrath (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_06.jpg","level":4,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.xteyBS2d1DUEHgyN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Domain Specialization (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_06.jpg","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KbH78K4CQJqWBOns","dataType":"compendium","name":"Opposition Alignment (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_06.jpg","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.JPB7bVlBhHaBHtLf","dataType":"compendium","name":"True Scion","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_06.jpg","level":10,"_index":5}]},"tag":"divineScion","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

In addition, she can use Craft (alchemy) to change the type of a poison with 1 hour of work and an alchemist&rsquo;s lab. If the Craft (alchemy) check (DC equals the poison&rsquo;s save DC) is successful, the poison&rsquo;s type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury; on a failed check, the poison is ruined.<br /><br /><strong>Poison Resistance (Ex)</strong>: A Daggermark poisoner gains a +2 bonus on saves against poison, increasing to +4 at 4th level, +6 at 7th level, and total immunity at 9th level. Alchemist levels stack with Daggermark poisoner levels when determining the effect of this ability.<br /><br /><strong>Quick Poisoning (Ex)</strong>: A Daggermark poisoner can poison a weapon as a move action. She can create poisons with the Craft (alchemy) skill in half the normal amount of time.<br /><br /><strong>Toxic Apothecary (Ex and Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Daggermark poisoner can use <em>detect poison </em>at will (range 5 feet, caster level equal to the Daggermark poisoner&rsquo;s class level) as a swift action. She gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her class level on Heal checks dealing with poison, and on a successful check she adds this bonus to the save bonus she provides her patient against the treated poison.<br /><br /><strong>Toxic Trick</strong>: At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, a Daggermark poisoner learns a toxic trick. She can use a number of toxic tricks each day equal to her Intelligence modifier + 1/2 her class level. The save DC of any saving throw called for by a toxic trick is equal to 10 + the Daggermark poisoner&rsquo;s class level + her Intelligence modifier. Spell-like abilities have a caster level equal to her class level.<br /><br /><em>Choking Bomb (Su)</em>: As the ninja trick (<em>Ultimate Combat </em>15), but with a DC as noted above.<br /><br /><em>Combine Poison (Ex)</em>: A Daggermark poisoner can combine two different poisons without reducing their efficacy, applying them to the same weapon, object, or trap. A creature exposed to the poisons must save against both.<br /><br /><em>Concentrate Poison (Su)</em>: As the alchemist discovery (<em>Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide </em>29).<br /><br /><em>Launch Trap (Ex)</em>: As the ranger&rsquo;s trapper archetype class feature (<em>Ultimate Magic </em>65).<br /><br /><em>Poison Bomb (Ex or Su)</em>: As the ninja trick (<em>Ultimate Combat</em> 15). A Daggermark poisoner must possess the smoke bomb toxic trick before selecting this trick.<br /><br /><em>Poison Conversion (Su)</em>: As the alchemist discovery (<em>Ultimate Combat </em>24).<br /><br /><em>Poison Trap (Ex or Su)</em>: As the ranger trap (<em>Ultimate Magic </em>64).<br /><br /><em>Slow-Acting Poison (Ex)</em>: When crafting a poison, a Daggermark poisoner may choose to create it with a delayed onset time. This delay must be at least 1 round but cannot be longer than 1 minute per class level.<br /><br /><em>Smoke Bomb (Ex or Su)</em>: As the ninja trick (<em>Ultimate Combat</em> 16), but no <em>ki </em>points are required.<br /><br /><em>Tailored Toxin (Ex)</em>: Choose one creature type (and subtype, for humanoids or outsiders). Poisons a Daggermark poisoner uses are particularly effective against creatures of this type, increasing the save DC by 2. This trick can be taken more than once; each time it applies to a different creature type (or subtype).<br /><br /><em>Toxic Magic (Sp)</em>: Choose one of the following spells or alchemical extracts as a spell-like ability: <em>accelerate poison</em><sup>APG</sup>, <em>delay poison</em>, <em>pernicious poison</em><sup>UM</sup>,<em> transmute potion to poison</em><sup>APG</sup>, or <em>venomous bolt</em><sup>APG</sup>. This trick can be taken more than once; each time it grants a different spell-like ability.<br /><br /><strong>Toxic Manufactory (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, when creating poisons or antitoxins a Daggermark poisoner can create a number of doses equal to her Intelligence modifier at one time (minimum 1). These additional doses do not increase the time required, but do increase the raw material cost accordingly. In addition, she uses the item&rsquo;s gp value as its sp value when determining progress made with her Craft (alchemy) checks. If the Daggermark poisoner has the Master Alchemist<em>APG</em> feat, she may create a number of doses of poison or antitoxin at one time equal to twice her Intelligence modifier and uses the item&rsquo;s pp value as its sp value when determining progress with her Craft (alchemy) checks.<br /><br /><strong>Trapster (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Daggermark poisoner adds her class level on Perception skill checks made to locate traps and on Craft and Disable Device checks made with poisonous traps. A Daggermark poisoner also adds a +1 bonus on attack rolls, save DCs, and Perception and Disable Device DCs for poisoned traps she creates. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and again at 9th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.XXBEObHI6px12TAK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Instantaneous Toxicology (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":8,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.A0eC027HeUke4GT1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Quick Poisoning (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.jNNOSzDKdnAqTrPm","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.heldfSxz0K2rIdre","dataType":"compendium","name":"Swift Poisoning (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":6,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hLZST0nU9mM10Bga","dataType":"compendium","name":"Toxic Apothecary (Ex and Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WD8GoAUfMIzhdHSl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Toxic Manufactory (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.BHRh4Kz6G9j5lvhN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Toxic Trick","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":2,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.K0modP8yUhhYONJh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Trapster (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":1,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.907Z7ILJsnNnzYRg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Treacherous Toxin (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":5,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LALfMIX6iQ7bGxlP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Master Poisoner (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_43.jpg","level":1,"_index":9}]},"tag":"daggermarkPoisoner","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Daggermark Poisoner","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Spurred by the words of their prophets, the ancient dwarves abandoned their homes deep within the subterranean realm of Nar-Voth and began the perilous search for the sky over 5 millennia ago. For 300 years, the dwarves fought their way upward, driving their hated enemies&mdash;the orcs&mdash; before them. When they finally breached the surface, these legendary heroes built 10 grand fortresses across the face of Golarion&mdash;the 10 magnificent Sky Citadels.<br /><br />In many ways, dwarven culture has been in decline since their fateful emergence. Four of the fabled Sky Citadels were lost to history or destroyed, and a fifth is now held by the orc hordes in the Hold of Belkzen. Many dwarves long for a return to their days of glory, when they stood upon the surface of Golarion as champions of both the surface and the Darklands below.<br /><br />Those dwarves who commit themselves to making this dream a reality are known as the skyseekers. They travel the width and breadth of Avistan as well as Garund, unearthing every scrap of dwarven history and lore they can find. Many form expeditions to explore the dwarven ruins left behind by their ancestors during the migration, often battling the foul creatures that lurk beneath Golarion&rsquo;s surface in their search for knowledge. Others hope to rediscover or retake one of the fabled Sky Citadels lost in the eons since the Quest for Sky.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a skyseeker, a

/><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A skyseeker is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (including tower shields).<br /><br /><strong>Ancestral Weapon (Su)</strong>: By inscribing ancient dwarven runes upon his weapon, a skyseeker forges it into a ref lection of the legendary weapons his ancestors bore during the Quest for Sky. When wielded by the skyseeker against a creature with the giant, goblin, or orc subtype, the weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of damage on a successful hit. As a free action, the skyseeker may also identify the weapon by name when making an Intimidate check against such creatures, granting him a competence bonus on his Intimidate check equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1).<br /><br />At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the extra damage dealt by the ancestral weapon increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 4d6 at 10th level. Forging a link between a weapon and the legendary weapons of old requires a 24-hour-long ritual, and only one weapon can be designated as an ancestral weapon at a time.<br /><br /><strong>Citadel Keeper (Sp)</strong>: A skyseeker has spent so much time studying the known Sky Citadels that he has memorized their locations by heart. He can determine the direction to the nearest known Sky Citadel at will, as though using the spell <em>know direction</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Rune-Carved Armor (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a skyseeker learns how to imbue his armor with a small semblance of the magical resistance his dwarven ancestors were renowned for. Against spells and spell-like abilities, he gains a def lection bonus to touch AC equal to his armor bonus. This bonus can&rsquo;t exceed his skyseeker level. This ability functions only while the skyseeker wears armor.<br /><br /><strong>Commune (Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, a skyseeker&rsquo;s bond with the spirits of his ancestors grows stronger, allowing him to use the spell <em>commune </em>once per week as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to the skyseeker&rsquo;s class level). <br /><br /><strong>Dwarven Armor Training (Ex)</strong>: By studying the arts of his ancestors, the skyseeker learns the secret techniques of his forebears&rsquo; forges and fighting styles. At 4th level, the skyseeker gains heavy armor proficiency, and he still benefits from his ranger combat style (if he has one) while wearing heavy armor.<br /><br /><strong>Darkvision (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a skyseeker grows more comfortable operating in the lightless depths of the dwarven ancestral homelands. He gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If he already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet. At 7th level, the range of the skyseeker&rsquo;s darkvision increases by an additional 30 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Runes of Resistance (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a skyseeker can use his armor to shrug off all manner of magical attacks for a short period of time. As a move action, the skyseeker can gain spell resistance equal to 5 + his Hit Dice if wearing light armor or 10 + his Hit Dice if wearing medium or heavy armor. Dismissing this ability is a swift action. A skyseeker can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his class level. These rounds need not be consecutive.<br /><br /><strong>Paths of the Ancients (Ex)</strong>: Other labyrinths pale in comparison to the tangled maze of tunnels left behind by the ancient sky-seeking dwarves. At 8th level, a skyseeker gains immunity to the maze spell and cannot become lost while exploring subterranean environments.<br /><br /><strong>Stalwart (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a skyseeker has honed his mental resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can be used only if the skyseeker is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless skyseeker does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.<br /><br /><strong>Call to Arms (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, a skyseeker grows so attuned with the spirits of his ancestors that he can channel them into the physical world to battle his enemies. Once per day as a full-round action, he can summon up to 1d4+1 ghostly dwarven allies, who must appear within 60 feet of the skyseeker. These dwarves function exactly as an ally produced by the spell <em>spiritual ally</em><sup>APG</sup> (caster level equal to the skyseeker&rsquo;s class level), except that they always appear as dwarves wielding warhammers and they share the skyseeker&rsquo;s favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses (if any). On subsequent turns the skyseeker can direct a single dwarven ally to move as a swift action, or he can direct multiple allies to move simultaneously as a move action.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.DZDOevpF9bXZlV4K","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ancestral Weapon (Su)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TbvDLeExa95hJvAL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Call to Arms (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":10,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.uSCbglpQH7L228AA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Citadel Keeper (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hH0McAlsx8oh49ln","dataType":"compendium","name":"Commune (Sp)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Pf7EdmZZY4WRWHI7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dwarven Armor Training (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.en8T5LXZmzQVfIsF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Paths of the Ancients (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":8,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5BfH9ib1COYX7e6O","dataType":"compendium","name":"Rune-Carved Armor (Su)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":2,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AKSeHYIPuy8e1Fq0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Runes of Resistance (Su)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":6,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.n7t0vnEQwKxK1yCQ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Stalwart (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":9,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2Yc2nrgOQBuoaaye","dataType":"compendium","name":"Darkvision (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/settlement/wizard-castle.webp","level":5,"_index":9}]},"tag":"skyseeker","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":true,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

She awards powerful insights into the nature of illusion and deception to those who are especially devout in their worship, possess exceptional skill in a craft, or simply manage to catch her eye. These rare few are known as veiled illusionists, the favored disciples of the Seventh Veil.<br /><br />While skilled in all forms of illusion, veiled illusionists primarily excel at casting glamers&mdash;spells that alter or conceal the illusionist&rsquo;s true form. Most veiled illusionists are uncomfortable with maintaining one disguise for an extended period of time. Instead, they prefer to change their appearance from day to day, or even from hour to hour. This makes it difficult for veiled illusionists to integrate fully into society, so most end up wanderers, taking on a new face with each new town they visit.</span></p>\n<h2

illusionist gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EYejyvbnCJKiWeel]{Veil Pool (Sp)}<br /><br /><strong>Veil Pool (Sp)</strong>: A veiled illusionist draws power from a reserve of magical energy to strengthen her illusions. This veil pool has a number of points equal to her class level + her Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma modifier (the character makes this choice at 1st level, after which it cannot be changed). The pool refreshes once per day when the veiled illusionist prepares her spells or regains spell slots.<br /><br />As a standard action, the veiled illusionist can spend 1 point from her veil pool to alter her appearance as per the spell <em>disguise self</em>. This is a glamer effect that lasts a number of hours equal to the veiled illusionist&rsquo;s class level. The DC to disbelieve the effect is equal to 15 + the number of points remaining in the veiled illusionist&rsquo;s veil pool.<br /><br />At 3rd level, the veiled illusionist can alter her perceived audible (sound) properties when she assumes her disguise.<br /><br />At 5th level, the veiled illusionist can also alter her perceived tactile (touch) properties, and can imitate any voice with which she is familiar. At 9th level, the veiled illusionist&rsquo;s veil fools even extraordinary senses, such as scent, blindsight, or tremorsense.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.K6E9dkSHjpWLGqKk]{Sivanah's Veils}<br /><br /><strong>Sivanah&rsquo;s Veils</strong>: A veiled illusionist learns to cloak herself in the forms favored by the goddess Sivanah&mdash;human, half ling, elf, gnome, cyclops, and naga. Once the veiled illusionist learns a veil, she can expend 1 point from her veil pool to disguise herself as a member of that veil&rsquo;s race as though using <em>disguise self</em>, even if doing so would exceed the limitations of <em>disguise self</em>. When disguising herself as one of these races, she gains an additional bonus on her Disguise check equal to her class level. Each veil also grants the illusionist an additional power. Assuming a different veil while still under the effects of her <em>disguise self </em>spell-like ability is a free action, and does not expend any additional points from her veil pool.<br /><br /><em>Human</em>: At 1st level, a veiled illusionist may select an illusion spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list of a level she can cast and add it to her class spell list at the same level. If the spell is already on her spell list, she adds it to her spellbook, familiar, or list of spells known. Each time the illusionist gains a level, she may select an additional illusion spell.<br /><br /><em>Halfling</em>: At 2nd level, a veiled illusionist can spend 1 point from her veil pool as a free action while casting an illusion spell to disguise her spellcasting. Creatures attempting to identify the spell as it&rsquo;s being cast must succeed at a Will save (DC 15 + the number of points remaining in the illusionist&rsquo;s veil pool) or misidentify the spell as a spell of the illusionist&rsquo;s choice. The illusory spell must be the same level as the true spell, and must be one the illusionist can cast.<br /><br /><em>Elf</em>: At 4th level, a veiled illusionist can spend 1 point from her veil pool as an immediate action to reroll a caster level check made to bypass spell resistance. She must use this ability before the results of the first roll are revealed, and must accept the second roll, even if it&rsquo;s worse.<br /><br /><em>Gnome</em>: At 6th level, a veiled illusionist can spend 1 point from her veil pool to concentrate on a glamer or figment as a swift action, rather than a standard action.<br /><br /><em>Cyclops</em>: At 8th level, a veiled illusionist can spend 1 point from her veil pool as a free action to gain the benefits of the spell <em>true seeing </em>until the beginning of her next turn.<br /><br /><em>Naga</em>: At 10th level, as a free action while casting an illusion spell, a veiled illusionist can spend 1 point from her veil pool to coil the illusion upon itself. Any creature that disbelieves the illusion sees a second illusion within the translucent outline of the first, as if the illusionist had cast the spell a second time. Effectively, after a creature disbelieves the first illusion, it sees a second illusion in its place, which it must attempt to disbelieve separately. The veiled illusionist must determine the features of the second illusion as she casts the first. If the second illusion is especially similar to the first one, creatures that study or interact with it receive a +4 bonus on the save to disbelieve the effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.JxaYqlni7bEqcfmM]{Quick Veil}<br /><br /><strong>Quick Veil</strong>: At 5th level, a veiled illusionist can assume or alter her disguise with her veil pool ability as a move action. At 7th level, the action is reduced to a swift action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qe83HMR0X35feTYp]{True Veil}<br /><br /><strong>True Veil</strong>: At 10th level, a veiled illusionist can spend 1 point from her veil pool to imbue her disguise with a measure of reality. The veiled illusionist&rsquo;s <em>disguise self</em> spell-like ability is treated as a polymorph effect, though it retains the illusion school and gains the shadow descriptor. Other creatures no longer get a Will save to recognize the effect as an illusion, though they can still make Perception checks to realize the veiled illusionist is using a disguise.<br /><br />If disguised as a humanoid using her veil pool ability, the veiled illusionist gains the benefit of <em>alter self</em>. If disguised as a cyclops or naga, she gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, a &ndash;2 penalty to Dexterity, a +4 natural armor bonus, and any of the following abilities possessed by the creature whose form she has taken: burrow 30 feet, climb 90 feet, fly 90 feet (good maneuverability), swim 90 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, ferocity, guarded thoughts, poison, and spit. The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to the veiled illusionist&rsquo;s level if she is disguised as a humanoid, or rounds per level if disguised as a cyclops or naga.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EYejyvbnCJKiWeel","dataType":"compendium","name":"Veil Pool (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.K6E9dkSHjpWLGqKk","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sivanah's Veils","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.uVLotE1ufXVHeEhO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Veil: Halfling","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.avUXHM4spiLowdoi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Veil: Elf","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":4,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.JxaYqlni7bEqcfmM","dataType":"compendium","name":"Quick Veil","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SRTdMxZ6f2s5E7T7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Veil: Gnome","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":6,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9PHWu63Gbhf3HMZZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Veil: Cyclops","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":8,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PheWeaNzKbmloqUq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Veil: Naga","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":10,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qe83HMR0X35feTYp","dataType":"compendium","name":"True Veil","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/iron-will.jpg","level":10,"_index":8}]},"tag":"veiledIllusionist","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The sentinel is a warrior who receives special powers in exchange for his service to a deity, and often serves as a guard for the deity&rsquo;s clergy. Some undergo official training, others experience visions leading them to their path, and some simply make the decision to pledge their lives to upholding their faith.<br /><br />Sentinels frequently clash with enemies of their deity or champions of rival faiths, and occasionally work with other sentinels to undertake great quests or overcome challenging obstacles. Some inspire unique warrior orders dedicated to their faith, and legendary champions of the faith are often sentinels.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a sentinel, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Within one step of chosen deity.<br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Must worship a single, specific deity.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Deific Obedience, Weapon Focus (deity&rsquo;s favored weapon).<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Base attack bonus +5 or higher.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Sentinel's class skills are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Obedience, symbolic weapon +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Bonus feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Divine boon 1, symbolic weapon +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Divine quickness +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Aligned strike, stalwart</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Divine boon 2, symbolic weapon +3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Bonus feat, practiced combatant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Divine quickness +4, righteous leader</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Divine boon 3, symbolic weapon +4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.312%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.527%;\">Unstoppable warrior</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the sentinel prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Sentinels are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).<br /><br /><strong>Obedience (Ex)</strong>: In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class, a sentinel must perform a daily obedience to his chosen deity (see page 10).<br /><br /><strong>Symbolic Weapon (Su)</strong>: When wielding his deity&rsquo;s favored weapon, the sentinel gains a +1 sacred or profane bonus on attack and damage rolls. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 3 levels he has in the sentinel prestige class (maximum +4). His deity&rsquo;s favored weapon also functions as a holy (or unholy) symbol when wielded by a sentinel.<br /><br /><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: At 2nd level and again at 7th level, the sentinel gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. Sentinel levels stack with f ighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats with a f ighter level prerequisite. If the bonus feat selected requires the sentinel to select a specif ic weapon for the feat to apply to (such as Greater Weapon Focus), the sentinel must select his deity&rsquo;s favored weapon.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Boon</strong>: As the sentinel gains levels, he gains boons from his chosen deity. The nature of these boons varies depending on the sentinel&rsquo;s chosen deity. Each deity grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the sentinel gains the f irst boon. At 6th level, he gains the second boon, and at 9th level, he gains the third boon. Consult the Deific Obedience feat on page 210 and the core deity descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these divine boons. When a divine boon grants a spell-like ability, the sentinel&rsquo;s caster level for the spell-like ability equals his total character level. This ability allows a sentinel to access these boons earlier than with the Deif ic Obedience feat alone; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.<br /><br /><strong>Divine Quickness (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 4th level, so long as the sentinel carries his deity&rsquo;s favored weapon, he gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus on initiative checks. The weapon doesn&rsquo;t need to be carried in hand, but must at least be on his person and accessible enough that he can wield it with no greater than a move action. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +4.<br /><br /><strong>Aligned Strike (Su)</strong>: The sentinel&rsquo;s righteous fervor allows him to cut through certain types of damage reduction. At 5th level, the sentinel gains the ability to bypass a specific type of damage reduction when wielding his deity&rsquo;s favored weapon. The type of damage reduction his weapon bypasses is based on his chosen deity&rsquo;s alignment. The sentinel chooses this type of damage reduction when he gains this ability and this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. He can choose only one of the aligned weapon types regardless of how many options he has based on his deity&rsquo;s alignment. For example, a sentinel of Iomedae can treat his weapon as axiomatic or holy, but not both. The choices are as follows.<br /><br /><em>Lawful</em>: The sentinel can treat his weapon as axiomatic if his deity is lawful.<br /><em>Chaotic</em>: The sentinel can treat his weapon as anarchic if his deity is chaotic.<br /><em>Good</em>: The sentinel can treat his weapon as holy if his deity is good.<br /><em>Evil</em>: The sentinel can treat his weapon as unholy if his deity is evil.<br /><em>Neutral</em>: The sentinel can choose one of the four other weapon alignment types if his deity is neutral.<br /><br /><strong>Stalwart (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, the sentinel gains mental fortitude through his constant meditation and adherence to religious tenets. He gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus on saving throws to resist divine spells.<br /><br /><strong>Practiced Combatant (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, the sentinel displays increased combat ability thanks to his extensive training and experience. He gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus on combat maneuvers he performs with his deity&rsquo;s favored weapon.<br /><br /><strong>Righteous Leader (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, the sentinel&rsquo;s commitment to his faith and the deeds he does in the name of his god add to his reputation. He gains Leadership as a bonus feat, and is considered to qualify for that feat&rsquo;s special power leadership modifier. He takes no penalty for moving around a lot (normally this imposes a &ndash;1 penalty to a character&rsquo;s leadership score) but he takes double the usual penalty for recruiting a cohort of a different alignment (&ndash;2 instead of &ndash;1).<br /><br /><strong>Unstoppable Warrior (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, the sentinel becomes a stalwart paragon demonstrating incredible combat prowess. He gains damage reduction based on the alignment of his deity, as shown in the table.<br /><br /></p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chosen Deity&rsquo;s Alignment</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Damage Reduction</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LG</td>\n<td>10/evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>5/evil and silver</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CG</td>\n<td>5/cold iron and evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LN</td>\n<td>10/chaotic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>3/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CN</td>\n<td>10/lawful</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LE</td>\n<td>10/good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NE</td>\n<td>5/good and silver</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CE</td>\n<td>5/cold iron and good</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />In addition, the sentinel no longer falls unconscious when reduced to a negative hit point total, though he can take only a single standard or move action while at negative hit points, and he continues to lose hit points normally if he is not stabilized. Taking standard actions after becoming stable causes the sentinel&rsquo;s wounds to reopen, and he begins losing hit points normally again.<br /><br />Once per day as a swift action, the sentinel can use <em>cure critical wounds</em>, but targeting only himself, with a caster level equal to his character level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.uIaU12ncJ26gg6oE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aligned Strike (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":5,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vp1VzQpH7ADN0qLp","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Feat","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FKiKyKrFelFvUTeL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Boon","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":3,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zFGzzj29uhZLSCB4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Quickness (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":4,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sCMGiuQQ3iCpx5Bf","dataType":"compendium","name":"Obedience (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tZfAwoFxjeQynFEY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Practiced Combatant (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":7,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.L8eMZWSaDNW4fv64","dataType":"compendium","name":"Righteous Leader (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":8,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gHlXKXXFXQkgAa2B","dataType":"compendium","name":"Stalwart (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":5,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kP2ZUR0IYYuE3VYN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Symbolic Weapon (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":1,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rZpTaq4uRnzfuw3j","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unstoppable Warrior (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_14.jpg","level":10,"_index":9}]},"tag":"sentinel","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","hvy","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The choice of order determines which disciplines the character later gains access to.<br /><br /><strong> Smite Chaos (Su)</strong>: This ability functions as the paladin&rsquo;s smite evil class feature but against chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey.<br /><br /><strong> Discern Lies (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Hellknight can use <em>discern lies</em> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier with a caster level equal to his character level.<br /><br /><strong> Hellknight Armor (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Hellknight earns the right to wear Hellknight plate (see page 97), which does not reduce his speed. While wearing this armor, the Hellknight reduces its armor check penalty by 1 and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 1. At 5th level, these adjustments increase to 2. At 8th level, these adjustments increase to 3.<br /><br /><strong> Disciplines</strong>: At 3rd level, a Hellknight gains access to his first discipline, choosing one associated with his specific order. At 6th level, the Hellknight gains a second discipline, choosing from any listed as being available to &ldquo;any order.&rdquo; At 9th level, the Hellknight gains his third discipline, choosing this one from any of the disciplines listed below, even those from another order, with the exception of pentamic faith. When applicable, the save DC to resist a discipline&rsquo;s effect is equal to 10 + the Hellknight&rsquo;s level + his Charisma modifier. The Hellknight can use any one discipline a number of times per day equal to the total number of disciplines he has access to, so at 3rd level he can use his discipline once per day. At 6th level, he can use both disciplines twice per day each. At 9th level, he can use all three of his disciplines three times per day.<br /><br />See <strong><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/HellknightDisciplines.aspx\">here</a></strong> for a full list of Hellknight Disciplines.<br /><br /><strong> Force of Will (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Hellknight gains a +2 bonus on Will saves against spells with any one of the following subschools or descriptors: charm, compulsion, glamer, fear, figment, pattern, or phantasm. At 6th level, the Hellknight chooses another subschool or descriptor from the list and gains a +2 bonus on his Will saves against spells of that type, and the bonus provided by his first selection increases to +4. At 9th level, he chooses from the list again, and both previous selections increase by 2, so that he has a +6, a +4, and a +2 bonus, respectively, against spells of three different groups.<br /><br /><strong> Lawbringer (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a Hellknight&rsquo;s attacks are treated as being lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br /><br /><strong> Infernal Armor (Su)</strong>: As long as he wears Hellknight armor, a 9th-level Hellknight gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-related checks made while interacting with lawful, nongood creatures.

The extra damage dealt starts at +1d6 and increases by +1d6 every four additional levels (5th, 9th). If a Gray Gardener gets sneak attack bonuses from other sources, the bonuses on damage rolls stack.<br /><br /><strong>Harsh Judgment (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Gray Gardener can pronounce judgment on his enemies. This ability functions like the inquisitor judgment ability, except a Gray Gardener can choose only the destruction, piercing, purity, and smiting judgments. For the purpose of determining the bonuses provided by these judgments, a Gray Gardener&rsquo;s class levels stack with any levels in other classes that grant the judgment ability. At 6th level, and again at 10th level, a Gray Gardener can use this ability one additional time per day.<br /><br /><strong>Stern Gaze (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Gray Gardener receives a morale bonus equal to 1/2 his class level on Intimidate and Sense Motive checks. A Gray Gardener&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels in other classes that grant the stern gaze ability.<br /><br /><strong>Bane (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Gray Gardener can enhance his weapon so it excels against certain foes. This ability is identical to the inquisitor&rsquo;s bane ability, and he can use it for a number of rounds per day equal to his class level. These rounds don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive.<br /><br /><strong>Dramatic Interrogation (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, if a Gray Gardener threatens a helpless creature, he gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform checks to inf luence creatures that have a starting attitude of hostile, unfriendly, friendly, or helpful toward the helpless creature, including the helpless creature itself.<br /><br /><strong>Execution Feats (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, the Gray Gardener gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These feats must be taken from the following list: Enforcer<sup>APG</sup>, Gang Up<sup>APG</sup>, Sidestep<sup>APG</sup>, Vital Strike. At 8th level, the following feats are added to the list: Dastardly Finish<sup>APG</sup>, Deadly Finish<sup>UC</sup>. A Gray Gardener need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.<br /><br /><strong>Grim Investigator (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a Gray Gardener can use Intimidate instead of Diplomacy to gather information. He can reroll any Sense Motive check that opposes someone&rsquo;s Bluff check before the results of the check are revealed, but must take the result of the reroll, even it&rsquo;s worse than the original.<br /><br /><strong>Second Judgment (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, whenever a Gray Gardener uses his judgment or harsh judgment ability, he selects two different judgments. This consumes only one use of this ability. As a swift action, he can change one of these judgments to another type.<br /><br /><strong>Improved Bane (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, whenever a Gray Gardener uses his bane ability, the damage dealt by the weapon against creatures of the selected type increases to 3d6.<br /><br /><strong>Sinister Bane (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, whenever a Gray Gardener uses the bane ability on a melee weapon, his weapon also gains the <em>menacing</em><sup>APG</sup> weapon special ability.<br /><br /><strong>Slaying Judgment (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, while using the judgment or harsh judgment ability, a Gray Gardener can declare a slaying judgment against a foe when he makes a melee attack (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the creature must make a Fortitude saving throw as if struck by a <em>slaying arrow </em>of its creature type. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + the Gray Gardener&rsquo;s class level + the Gray Gardener&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier. A Gray Gardener can use this ability once per day.<br /><br /><strong>Greater Bane (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, whenever a Gray Gardener uses his bane ability the damage dealt by the weapon against creatures of the selected type increases to 4d6.<br /><br /><strong>Final Demise (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, once per week, when a Gray Gardener kills a creature with a melee weapon, he can draw the soul out of the dead body and imprison it in his weapon as if using a <em>soul bind </em>spell (caster level equal to the Gray Gardener&rsquo;s character level). Destroying the weapon or dispelling this effect frees the soul. After spending 24 hours in the weapon, the captured soul escapes. However, by touching the weapon holding a captured soul to a <em>final blade</em>, the Gray Gardener can transfer the soul into the magical guillotine to remain trapped inside indefinitely. In addition, at 10th level, a Gray Gardener receives initiation in the secret rituals that can release a soul from a <em>final blade </em>(<em>The Inner Sea World Guide </em>300).<br /><br /><strong>True Death (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, anyone slain by a Gray Gardener becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Attempts to use <em>raise dead </em>or similar magic to resurrect such a creature require a successful DC 25 caster level check, or the spell fails and any material components are wasted.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.A31OFBWvPFQCTFt7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Stern Gaze (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.McMtuVjwzBtWa5Fg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Oie7J3RlrcKu6A9s","dataType":"compendium","name":"Slaying Judgment (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":8,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.E5neBwg6ktVM3pnL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sinister Bane (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":7,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AJxodR29Rk3wiHnh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Second Judgment (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2qPHyVNE1lnEYLXn","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Bane (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SAV65RZtoXBcCKbP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Harsh Judgment (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":2,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9WoKOIERN23DJ7f7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Grim Investigator (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":4,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cPXBZYya6CaL3qJl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Bane (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":9,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.btCX9EqiUPkCYVlE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Final Demise (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":10,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gmNyHZJKrFygQJYn","dataType":"compendium","name":"Execution Feats (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":4,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.CK0R5YUIA2nZtBuy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dramatic Interrogation (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":3,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3Jy5Y4DhjmQprvLj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bane (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":3,"_index":12},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Zv5eTbRpRYavLGcK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Anonymity (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-norman-brutal.webp","level":1,"_index":13}]},"tag":"grayGardener","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Today, Westcrown honors Aroden&rsquo;s legacy with memorial statues, cathedrals, and other remembrances. The Council of Thieves, for its part, trains its members with Aroden&rsquo;s favored weapon, the longsword&mdash;a weapon the god used to great effect by eschewing strength for finesse and expertise. A Westcrown devil can use Weapon Finesse with a longsword sized for him when he wields it one-handed, even though it is not a light weapon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YCT3N8TaDSPt1AQb]{Founders' Favor (Su)}&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Founders&rsquo; Favor (Su)</strong>: A group known as the founders of Aroden are the patrons of Westcrown. So strong are the traditions this group imprinted on the city that even Cheliax&rsquo;s relatively recent dedication to the Prince of Darkness has not effaced their mark upon the City of Twilight. A Westcrown devil learns to call upon the founders&rsquo; spiritual power, enjoying a mastery of the city matched by few.<br /><br />At 1st level, a Westcrown devil gains a pool of favor points equal to his class level + his Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). In addition to the powers inspired by specific founders (see below), the Westcrown devil can spend one favor point to add a bonus equal to half her class level (minimum +1) on a skill check without spending an action. The Westcrown devil must use this ability before learning the result of the check, and he can add this additional bonus only once per skill check. The pool of favor is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest.<br /><br />As the Westcrown devil gains levels, he learns to call upon powers inspired by specific founders. The caster level of spell-like abilities used this way is equal to the character&rsquo;s class level. Effects (including spell-like abilities) that allow a saving throw have a DC equal to 10 + the Westcrown devil&rsquo;s class level + the Westcrown devil&rsquo;s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). <br /><br /><em>Eye of Vadrus (Su)</em>: The patron of glassmakers allows the Westcrown devil to turn walls to glass. At 1st level, as a fullround action that costs 1 favor point, the Westcrown devil can see the internal workings of a lock, trap, or similar device that he touches. He gains a +4 bonus on Disable Device checks to disable this device. At 4th level, he can use eye of Vadrus to see through a section of any door or wall he is adjacent to and touches, as though a section of that wall or door no larger than 5 square feet were transparent. This effect works only on walls or doors that are no thicker than 6 inches. This effect lasts 1 round per class level. <br /><br /><em>Crucisal&rsquo;s Guidance (Su)</em>: The patron of navigation guides the Westcrown devil while hindering any pursuit. At 3rd level, when in an urban environment, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as a swift action to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his base speed and a +4 insight bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks for 1 minute. Whenever the Westcrown devil spends favor to improve a skill check as part of a chase (<em>GameMastery Guide</em> 232) or pursuit (<em>Ultimate Intrigue</em> 142), he adds 2d6 to his check instead of 1d6. <br /><br /><em>Adel&rsquo;s Craftsmanship (Sp)</em>: The patron of woodcraft imparts mastery over such creations. At 5th level, as a standard action, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use <em>warp wood</em> or <em>meld into wood</em> (as per <em>meld into stone</em>, except that the wood can be of any size or dimensions). If the Westcrown devil is 8th level or higher, he can use this ability as <em>passwall</em> through wooden barriers or <em>statue</em> to assume the form of a statue made of wood (hardness 5) instead.<br /><br /><em>Rixana&rsquo;s Bounty (Sp)</em>: Calling upon the patron of the bounty of deep waters allows for safe navigation of underwater regions. At 7th level, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as an immediate action to grant the benefits of <em>water breathing</em> for 24 hours. When he activates this ability, he can affect other creatures he can touch by spending 1 additional favor point for each added creature.<br /><br /><em>Palmor&rsquo;s Recovery (Sp)</em>: The patron of renewal grants access to powerful healing. At 8th level, as a standard action, a Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use <em>cure serious wounds</em> or <em>lesser restoration</em>. He can spend 3 favor points in a 1-minute ritual to use <em>break enchantment</em> or <em>restoration</em> (requiring expensive material components as appropriate).<br /><br /><em>Dotara&rsquo;s Shroud (Su)</em>: Experienced Westcrown devils gain the favor of the patron of the dottari (city guard). At 9th level, the Westcrown devil gains a +5 insight bonus on all skill checks opposed by or targeting city guards, a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks from city guards, and a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against effects created by city guards. This ability is constant and applies only while the Westcrown devil has at least 1 favor point remaining.<br /><br /><em>Arodennama&rsquo;s Avatar (Su or Sp)</em>: Westcrown&rsquo;s greatest monument, the Arodennama, symbolizes the dead god of humanity, and the Westcrown devil can draw inspiration from this towering statue to invoke Aroden&rsquo;s authority or mastery of the blade. At 10th level, the Westcrown devil can use his favor ability to improve attack rolls with longswords as if they were skill checks. In addition, as a full-round action, the Westcrown devil can spend 2 favor points to issue a <em>suggestion</em>, or spend 5 favor points to issue a <em>mass suggestion</em>. These function as the spells of the same name except that they affect only humans.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.b7zs4iiwttWWQ2YS]{Council's Secret}<br /><br /><strong>Council&rsquo;s Secret</strong>: At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Westcrown devil gains a rogue talent, selected from those available to rogues. The Westcrown devil treats his character level as his rogue level for the purpose of determining the talents&rsquo; effects. At 6th level, whenever the Westcrown devil would select a rogue talent, he can select an advanced talent instead.<br /><br />Alternatively, the Westcrown devil can focus on occult studies instead. If he chooses this option, when he would gain a talent via this ability, his spellcasting ability in a psychic spellcasting class he has increases by 1 level instead. The Westcrown devil can gain a level of spellcasting in this way once, plus one additional time at 6th and 10th levels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.VZbW7Lp3dyVIEDo1]{Sneak Attack (Ex)}<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Westcrown devil gains sneak attack as per the rogue class feature. The extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and it increases to 2d6 at 6th level, and to 3d6 at 9th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WTgnrZJsPLZcTGDv","dataType":"compendium","name":"Classically Trained (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YCT3N8TaDSPt1AQb","dataType":"compendium","name":"Founders' Favor (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.N4WwxQrSEbDrZuha","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favor: Eye of Vadrus (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.b7zs4iiwttWWQ2YS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Council's Secret","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Fb7VxWMSOZRN71K8","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favor: Crucisal's Guidance (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.VZbW7Lp3dyVIEDo1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Kp2aTC8zoW2EMkxw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favor: Adel's Craftsmanship (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":5,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qTQM8FDsciPrONer","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favor: Rixana's Bounty (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":7,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.m02DPbZYiigisLDw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favor: Palmor's Recovery (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":8,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LHPUMNPUGGmak5mV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favor: Dotara's Shroud (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":9,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.coQxwFObkBxmimp7","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favor: Arodennama's Avatar (Su or Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_02.jpg","level":10,"_index":10}]},"tag":"westcrownDevil","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"Longswords"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The foremost protectors of Andoran and its populace, the Golden Legionnaires primarily guard Andoran&rsquo;s borders and watch over the country&rsquo;s untamed rural areas.<br /><br />Within Andoran&rsquo;s borders, Golden Legionnaires operate independently alongside the nation&rsquo;s armed forces as members of elite military units. These highly capable field commanders and training officers adjust to suit the needs of a particular region, often developing specialized talents to counter specific threats found nearby. Angry fey in the Verduran Forest, tricky kobold traps near the Candlestone Caverns, and dangerous werewolves in Darkmoon Vale all threaten the Golden Legionnaires and their mission to safeguard their homeland. In Andoran&rsquo;s towns and cities, teams of Golden Legionnaires work to thwart spies and sinister agents of foreign powers, such as devious Taldan poisoners, Chelish diabolists, and Okeno bounty hunters.<br /><br />Above all else, the Golden Legion&rsquo;s duty is domestic security; the Legion extensively trains its soldiers in defensive tactics and strategies that ensure the protection of both Andorens and other members of the Legion. That said, a typical Golden Legionnaire exhibits audacious courage and unflinchingly puts himself between those he protects and possible threats. An ambush or unprovoked attack incenses a Golden Legionnaire and propels him to acts of selfless bravery and daring prowess. Even when they are hundreds of miles away from their homes, Golden Legionnaires use their skills and combat prowess to protect their allies and Andoran&rsquo;s ideals.<br /><br />While a large proportion of Golden Legionnaire candidates enlist from within the ranks of the Andoren military, the Legion recruits a number of nontraditional soldiers for their special skills. Applicants must demonstrate their devotion to the Andoren ideals of equality, freedom, and justice, as well as obtain a written recommendation from a senior Eagle Knight&mdash;or, under unusual circumstances, the personal recommendation of a member of the People&rsquo;s Council, Andoran&rsquo;s legislative body.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Golden Legionnaire, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any good. <br /><strong>Armor Proficiency</strong>: Must be proficient with heavy armor. <br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Diplomacy 5 ranks, Intimidate 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: A senior Eagle Knight must invite the character into the organization.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Golden Legionnaire's class skills are Climb (Str), Heal (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Authoritative command +1, defy danger 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Legion feat, intercept, united defense +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Allied retribution _1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Improved aid +1, legion feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Defy danger 2, hold the line</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Authoritative command +2, legion feat, united defense +4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Allied retribution +2, preemptive strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Authoritative command (swift), legion feat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Defy danger 3, improved aid +2, retaliate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.6898%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.4014%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.5829%;\">Guardian of liberty, united defense +6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Golden Legionnaire prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A Golden Legionnaire gains proficiency with all simple weapons and all martial weapons, and gains proficiency with all forms of armor and shields.<br /><br /><strong>Authoritative Command (Ex)</strong> As a move action, a Golden Legionnaire can issue orders to a number of allies up to half his character level who are within 30 feet and can see, hear, and understand him. As long as at least one selected ally obeys the Golden Legionnaire&rsquo;s orders during that round, the Golden Legionnaire and each compliant ally gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws and to Armor Class for 1 round. Affected allies are not under any obligation to obey these commands, but do not gain the bonuses if they ignore the commands. At 6th level, this bonus increases to +2. At 8th level, a Golden Legionnaire can use authoritative command as a swift action.<br /><br /><strong> Defy Danger (Ex)</strong>: A Golden Legionnaire gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against one of the following dangers: charms and compulsions, curses, diseases, fear, poisons, traps, or the innate magical powers (spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities not gained from class levels) of one creature type (and subtype, if applicable) chosen from the ranger favored enemy list. At 5th level and again at 9th level, a Golden Legionnaire gains an additional +2 bonus against a different danger; alternatively, he can increase the bonus against a previously selected danger by 2.<br /><br /><strong> Legion Feats</strong>: A Golden Legionnaire gains the following bonus feats at the prescribed levels, even if he doesn&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites: 2nd level&mdash;Stand Still, 4th level&mdash; Bodyguard<sup>APG</sup>, 6th level&mdash;In Harm&rsquo;s Way<sup>APG</sup>, 8th level&mdash; Swift Aid<sup>APG</sup>. If he already has the feat for a given level, he can instead take any other combat feat whose prerequisites he meets.<br /><br /><strong> Intercept (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Golden Legionnaire gains a bonus equal to half his class level on combat maneuver checks when using the Stand Still feat, and gains the same bonus to his CMD when an opponent attempts an Acrobatics check to move through a square he threatens.<br /><br /><strong> United Defense (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Golden Legionnaire can select one ally as a swift action. While he is adjacent to this ally, the Golden Legionnaire takes a &ndash;1 penalty to his Armor Class and the selected ally receives a +2 dodge bonus to his Armor Class for 1 round. At 6th level and again at 10th level, the Golden Legionnaire&rsquo;s AC takes an additional &ndash;1 penalty and the dodge bonus increases by an additional 2.<br /><br /><strong> Allied Retribution (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, if a Golden Legionnaire sees a creature within 60 feet of him attack an ally or any friendly creature, including himself, he can select that attacker as a designated adversary. When a Golden Legionnaire does this, he gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against the designated adversary for a number of rounds equal to his class level. A Golden Legionnaire can have a number of designated adversaries up to one-third his class level. If he already has his maximum number of designated adversaries selected, he can end the effects of his allied retribution against one of his previously designated adversaries and select a new one. The Golden Legionnaire can reselect a creature that is already a designated adversary if it attacks an ally or a friendly creature again, allowing him to restart the effect&rsquo;s duration.

These rulers, the Jadwiga, have the bitter blood of Baba Yaga running through their veins, and possess unique abilities that make them unparalleled in their power over ice, snow, and cold.<br /><br />Not all winter witches have a blood connection to the nobility of Irrisen. Some have their craft passed down to them by wizened mentors, and others hear their calling in the howling winds of a freezing winter&rsquo;s night. Of those winter witches who live outside Irrisen, many subsist on the fringes of civilization or in the wild, often concealing their powers lest they be seen as Irriseni spies. This is particularly true in the lands of the Linnorm Kings, where memories of the Winter War with Irrisen fuel long-held hatreds, as well as in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, whose superstitious tribespeople deeply distrust most forms of arcane magic.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a winter witch, a character must fulfill all the following

/><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A winter witch gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a winter witch gains new spells per day and patron spells as if she had also gained a level in the witch class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained except for additional spells per day and an increased effective level of spellcasting.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fcazfxIOWSxAtT4i]{Hyperboreal Patronage}<br /><strong>Hyperboreal Patronage</strong>: A winter witch&rsquo;s patron reveals an icy aspect. A winter witch adds the following spells to her spell list at the listed class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd&mdash;<em>wall of ice</em>, 5th&mdash;<em>icy prison</em><sup>UM</sup>, 7th&mdash;<em>freezing sphere</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3y651H8L8AxAMN43]{Winter Witchcraft}<br /><strong>Winter Witchcraft</strong>: Levels of the winter witch prestige class stack with witch levels for determining when a witch learns new hexes, the effect of her hexes and other witch class abilities (including archetype abilities), the abilities of her witch&rsquo;s familiar, and the level at which she can select major hexes or grand hexes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.DsJyjV9Oj57MXU9j]{Freeze and Thaw (Su)}<br /><strong>Freeze and Thaw (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a winter witch can freeze water or melt ice and snow with a touch. As a standard action, a winter witch can melt an adjacent 5-foot cube of ice or a 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of water equal to 10% of the snow&rsquo;s volume. Alternatively, a winter witch can freeze 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature unless it&rsquo;s helpless. This ability cannot affect water that is within a creature. One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about 60 pounds.<br /><br />This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ZyLpt0jAkscvRIkL]{Unnatural Cold (Su)}<br /><strong>Unnatural Cold (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, whenever a winter witch&rsquo;s spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having half their normal cold resistance when determining the damage dealt.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kg2aBHv1n6Exxkb0]{Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp)}<br /><strong>Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, a winter witch can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that suits her purpose (as <em>stone shape</em>, except that it works with ice). This ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level, this ability functions on ice or snow like the <em>fabricate </em>spell, increasing the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The winter witch must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the <em>fabricate </em>version of this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class level before returning to normal ice. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9a72lE8yn7291hUN]{Winter Hex}<br /><strong>Winter Hex</strong>: Starting at 5th level, whenever a winter witch can choose a major hex, she must choose from the following hexes: ice tomb<sup>UM</sup>, hoarfrost<sup>UM</sup>, numbing chill (see below). Once the winter witch has selected all three winter hexes, she may thereafter choose any other hex she meets the prerequisites for.<br /><br /><em>Numbing Chill (Su)</em>: Whenever the winter witch casts a spell that deals cold damage, she can imbue the spell with a debilitating eldritch chill as a swift action. She chooses one of the spell&rsquo;s targets or a creature within the spell effect. If that creature takes cold damage from the spell, it must also succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and be staggered for 1 round. The creature need only make this saving throw once per spell, even if the spell deals damage multiple times. If the target saves successfully, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8mHVU9sjAj5V3BLr]{Blizzard Sight (Su)}<br /><strong>Blizzard Sight (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a winter witch can see normally in natural or magical rain, sleet, hail, fog, snowstorms, blizzards, and similar weather conditions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gEwTmoMYjVvQuZlP]{Unearthly Cold (Su)}<br /><strong>Unearthly Cold (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a winter witch&rsquo;s spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that deal cold damage become horrendously cold. Half the cold damage caused by these effects comes from an otherworldly power and is not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based attacks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tJGZCuIbEhs1oht6]{Iceglide (Su)}<br /><strong>Iceglide (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a winter witch can move effortlessly at her base land speed through ice or snow. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, and doesn&rsquo;t create any ripple or other sign of passage. While icegliding, a winter witch can breathe normally. A <em>control water </em>spell cast on an area containing an icegliding winter witch flings her back 30 feet in a random direction, stunning her for 1 round unless she succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. A winter witch can use this ability for 10 minutes per day. This time need not be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Activating this ability is a swift action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.r3qzzfr6CETVEm0w]{Inexorable Cold (Su)}<br /><strong>Inexorable Cold (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a winter witch casts spells with the cold descriptor at +1 caster level. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks to counterspell, dispel, or penetrate spell resistance with these spells, and the DC to counterspell or dispel these spells increases by 1.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fcazfxIOWSxAtT4i","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hyperboreal Patronage","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.3y651H8L8AxAMN43","dataType":"compendium","name":"Winter Witchcraft","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.DsJyjV9Oj57MXU9j","dataType":"compendium","name":"Freeze and Thaw (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ZyLpt0jAkscvRIkL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unnatural Cold (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kg2aBHv1n6Exxkb0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9a72lE8yn7291hUN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Winter Hex","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8mHVU9sjAj5V3BLr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blizzard Sight (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":6,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gEwTmoMYjVvQuZlP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unearthly Cold (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":8,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tJGZCuIbEhs1oht6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Iceglide (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":10,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.r3qzzfr6CETVEm0w","dataType":"compendium","name":"Inexorable Cold (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/ice_08.jpg","level":10,"_index":9}]},"tag":"winterWitch","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The athletic fanatics known as darechasers seek out these untamed obstacles as challenges against which to test their strength. In order to continue improving, darechasers must often resort to besting their own records. Sometimes a darechaser will even bet against herself, only to strain to prove herself wrong and amaze bystanders. Darechasers travel widely and delight in both officiating competitions and performing physical feats that inspire a new generation of athleticism. Some even go so far as to use sports as a form of diplomacy, settling disputes with athletic competitions.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a darechaser, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5.<br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Lawful good, neutral good, or chaotic good.<br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Must worship Kurgess.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Athletic.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Acrobatics 5 ranks, Climb 5 ranks, Swim 5 ranks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Darechaser's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Perception (Wis), Perform (Cha), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline rush +1, dare +1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline deed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline rush +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline deed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline rush +3, dare +1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline deed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline rush +4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline deed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline rush +5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.07441%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.4377%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.86965%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 45.6238%;\">Adrenaline deed, dare +1d10, record breaker</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />Below are the class features of the darechaser prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Adrenaline Rush (Ex)</strong>: A darechaser can call upon her inner reserves of strength and speed as a free action to overcome otherwise insurmountable obstacles. A darechaser can harness this energy for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can use adrenaline rush for an additional 2 rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution do not allow her to use this ability for additional rounds per day. If she has the rage class feature, she can expend rounds of rage to activate and sustain her adrenaline rush (e.g. for making Constitution checks).<br /><br />While experiencing an adrenaline rush, a darechaser gains a +1 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Constitution, Dexterity, Escape Artist, Ride, Strength, and Swim checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter (maximum +5).<br /><br />A darechaser can end her adrenaline rush as a free action and is fatigued afterward for a number of rounds equal to double the number of rounds she used this ability. A darechaser can&rsquo;t begin an adrenaline rush while fatigued or exhausted. If she falls unconscious, she can choose to continue her adrenaline rush.<br /><br /><strong>Dare (Ex)</strong>: As a swift action while using her adrenaline rush, a darechaser can expend a round of her adrenaline rush to dare herself to accomplish a great deed. Although many announce these dares aloud, the ability functions as long as she can coherently and mentally articulate her dare; she cannot use this ability while confused, dazed, stunned, or panicked. She can use it while using the rage class feature, but only if she loudly announces the dare (treat this as having audible components&mdash;it can be defeated by magical silence). Once she declares her dare, the darechaser can add 1d6 to the result of any one attack roll, saving throw, or other check that directly helps her fulfill the dare. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she can roll another 1d6 and add it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At 5th level, she can instead add 1d8 to the result of one check to fulfill a dare, rolling an additional die only if she rolls a natural 8. At 10th level, she can instead add 1d10 to the result of one check, rolling an additional die only if she rolls a natural 10.<br /><br />A darechaser thrives on challenging herself to accomplish difficult goals, and she receives little satisfaction when fulfilling easy objectives. If her check succeeded only because of the additional die&rsquo;s (or dice&rsquo;s) result, she benefits from one of the following effects (chosen by her) immediately after fulfilling the dare. If she succeeds at the check despite the added die&rsquo;s result, she gains no additional benefit.<br /><br /><em>Daring Endurance</em>: The darechaser immediately gains temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + her class level. These temporary hit points last for the duration of her adrenaline rush and stack with any temporary hit points granted by the unstoppable adrenaline deed.<br /><br /><em>Daring Finish</em>: The darechaser doesn&rsquo;t become fatigued if she ends her adrenaline rush before the end of her next turn.<br /><br /><em>Daring Persistence</em>: The darechaser immediately regains 1d2 rounds of her adrenaline rush ability.<br /><br /><strong>Adrenaline Deed (Ex)</strong>: As a darechaser gains experience, she learns to leverage her adrenaline in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, she gains an adrenaline deed from the following list that grants her additional benefits while she is using her adrenaline rush ability. She can&rsquo;t choose an individual adrenaline deed more than once.<br /><br /><em>Dare-Driven</em>: If the darechaser adds 1d8 to a roll as a part of a dare, she can roll again and add the result if she rolls a natural 7 or 8 (not just an 8). If she rolls 1d10, she instead rolls again on a result of a natural 9 or 10.<br /><br /><em>Diehard Performer</em>: The darechaser adds her adrenaline rush bonus on all Perform checks and performance combat checks (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 153</em>). <br /><br /><em>Impossible Speed</em>: The darechaser&rsquo;s base speed increases by 10 feet. At 6th level, her speed instead increases by 20 feet, and at 10th level it increases by 30 feet.<br /><br /><em>Mounted Adrenaline</em>: The darechaser shares the base effects of her adrenaline surge (but not any adrenaline deeds) with her mount, as long as the darechaser is mounted on it or adjacent to it.<br /><br /><em>Powerful Climber</em>: The darechaser gains a natural climb speed equal to her land speed.<br /><br /><em>Powerful Leaper</em>: The darechaser always counts as having a running start when jumping, and she triples her adrenaline rush bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump. Powerful Swimmer: The darechaser gains a natural swim speed equal to her land speed.<br /><br /><em>Unstoppable</em>: When the darechaser begins her adrenaline rush, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 &times; her class level. These temporary hit points last for the duration of her adrenaline rush. In addition, she doubles her adrenaline rush bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize while dying.<br /><br /><strong>Untouchable</strong>: The darechaser gains a +1 dodge bonus to her Armor Class. At 6th level this increases to +2, and at 10th level it increases to +3.<br /><br /><strong>Record Breaker (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, a darechaser can push herself to surpass known mortal limits. Once per day, she can use her dare ability to add 2 &times; the normal number of bonus dice to a d20 roll. If she applies this benefit to a check modified by her adrenaline rush, she instead rolls and adds 3 &times; the number of bonus dice.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qz3sBtaFF0ykzxFG","dataType":"compendium","name":"Adrenaline Deed (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/nimble-moves.png","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sYpUn32u8UCvhGAb","dataType":"compendium","name":"Adrenaline Rush (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/nimble-moves.png","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4hkvJKRAMWZf51V9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dare (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/nimble-moves.png","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qRpZW1yfWTOSn5vz","dataType":"compendium","name":"Daring Endurance","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/nimble-moves.png","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.G3oZrlX9em3ZSXpx","dataType":"compendium","name":"Daring Finish","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/nimble-moves.png","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aCrUAbmAwonehlWI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Daring Persistence","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/nimble-moves.png","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9WMAeWlP2sDVc3Cg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Record Breaker (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/nimble-moves.png","level":10,"_index":6}]},"tag":"darechaser","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Darechaser","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

In their ethos, only through the accumulated perfection of each individual can societal transformation truly occur. Though Irori&rsquo;s core teachings apply equally to good, evil, and neutral individuals, champions of Irori focus on embodying and promulgating the virtues of hard work, discipline, and devotion to the causes of justice, truth, and the pursuit of perfection. It is only through this pursuit that individuals can realize true joy and liberate themselves from the cycles of reincarnation to serve the Master of Masters in the life beyond life.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a champion of Irori, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Lawful good.<br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Must worship Irori.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, 5 ranks total in Linguistics or other Knowledge skills.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Smite evil class feature, still mind class feature.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Champion of Irori's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">Detect chaos, martial artist, smite chaos</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\"><em>Ki</em> pool, pursuit of knowledge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">Sweeping smite (one target)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">Valiant stand</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">Shield the weak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">Skill mastery, sweeping smite (multiple targets)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">Perfect opening</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">One finger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">Perfect strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.88211%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.8851%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.486%;\">Whirlwind smite</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the champion of Irori prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A champion of Irori gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Detect Chaos (Sp)</strong>: This ability functions like a paladin&rsquo;s <em>detect evil </em>ability, but detects chaos instead of evil.<br /><br /><strong>Martial Artist (Ex)</strong>: The class levels of a champion of Irori stack with monk levels for determining the effect of his AC bonus, flurry of blows, stunning fist, and unarmed strike class features.<br /><br /><strong>Smite Chaos (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a champion of Irori gains an additional use of his paladin&rsquo;s smite evil ability. In addition, he can choose to use his smite evil ability to smite chaos instead, affecting chaotic-aligned creatures and dealing 2 points of damage per class level on the first successful attack against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey. Levels in this class stack with paladin levels for the purpose of determining how much damage a paladin of Irori deals to targets of his smite. A champion of Irori cannot have both a smite evil and smite chaos effect active at the same time; using one while the other is active immediately ends the older effect. At 8th level, a champion of Irori gains an additional use of his smite evil ability.<br /><br /><strong>Ki Pool (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a champion of Irori gains a <em>ki</em> pool equal to 1/2 his class level + his Wisdom modifier; this functions like the monk ability of the same name, and levels in this class stack with levels in other classes that grant a <em>ki </em>pool. In addition to the normal uses of this <em>ki</em> pool, a champion of Irori may expend 2 <em>ki </em>points to trigger either his lay on hands ability (if he has it) or his smite evil ability. His class levels stack with paladin levels when determining the effect of such abilities.<br /><br /><strong>Pursuit of Knowledge (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a champion of Irori adds 1/2 his class level on all Knowledge checks and can make Knowledge skill checks untrained.<br /><br /><strong>Sweeping Smite (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, as a standard action, a champion of Irori can make a single unarmed strike while using his smite evil or smite chaos ability. If the attack hits, he can make another attack at the same bonus against an evil or chaotic creature adjacent to the first and also within reach. He gains the benefits of smite chaos or smite evil (whichever he was already using), except for additional damage for the first attack, against that creature until the beginning of his next turn. This does not require an additional daily use of smite evil or smite chaos.<br /><br />At 6th level, a champion of Irori can use this ability to attack any number of opponents, as long as each is within his threatened area and adjacent to the previous target. This ability functions similarly to the Cleave and Great Cleave feats, but does not stack with them and does not result in an AC penalty.<br /><br /><strong>Valiant Stand (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a champion of Irori gains a sacred bonus on attack rolls and to AC equal to 1/2 his class level when adjacent to more than one opponent. He does not gain this bonus if he is also adjacent to an ally.<br /><br /><strong>Shield the Weak (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, as an immediate action once per round, a champion of Irori can shield a number of adjacent allies equal to his Wisdom modifier from a burst, cone, line, or spread effect that allows a Ref lex saving throw and which he and his allies are all affected by. The champion of Irori must forgo his own saving throw, but adjacent allies gain improved cover against the effect, providing a +4 bonus on Reflex saves and improved evasion against the effect.<br /><br /><strong>Skill Mastery</strong>: At 6th level, a champion of Irori becomes well practiced in a certain number of his skills. This ability functions exactly like the skill mastery advanced rogue talent.<br /><br /><strong>Perfect Opening (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, once per round a champion of Irori can make an attack of opportunity against an enemy he threatens when that enemy confirms a critical hit against the champion or an ally. The champion of Irori can make this attack of opportunity even if he would be killed or incapacitated by the critical hit, resolving the attack after the critical hit deals damage but before he falls unconscious or dies. If the champion of Irori&rsquo;s attack of opportunity hits, it is automatically a critical threat.<br /><br /><strong>One Finger (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, as a standard action, a champion of Irori can resolve a single unarmed attack as a melee touch attack.<br /><br /><strong>Perfect Strike (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, a champion of Irori can expend 1 point from his <em>ki </em>pool as a swift action to perfect the next unarmed attack he makes before the end of his turn. Attack and damage rolls are rolled twice and the champion of Irori selects which result to use.<br /><br /><strong>Whirlwind Smite (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, as a full-round action, a champion of Irori can make one unarmed strike against every creature he threatens, as if he possessed the Whirlwind Attack feat (though he can use it only with unarmed strikes).

class. <br /><br /><strong>Ashavic Performance (Su)</strong>: An Ashavic dancer can use Perform (dance) to create magical effects, as per the bardic performance bard class feature, for a number of rounds per day equal to twice his Ashavic dancer level. He can also use rounds of bardic performance gained from bard levels to perform Ashavic performances, and vice versa. Starting an Ashavic performance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. If the Ashavic dancer has bardic performance, he can also start bardic performances as a move action instead of a standard action even if he does not have sufficient bard levels to do so. The performance cannot be disrupted, but ends immediately if the dancer is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. The performance counts as a bardic performance for the purpose of determining how many performances the dancer can have in effect at one time. The performance has visual components but not audible components. At 7th level, an Ashavic dancer can start an Ashavic performance or a bardic performance as a swift action. The save DC against an Ashavic dancer&rsquo;s performance is equal to 10 + the Ashavic dancer&rsquo;s class level + his Charisma modifier. The performance abilities that an Ashavic dancer gains are noted below.<br /><em>Deathwaking Dance (Su)</em>: At 1st level, an Ashavic dancer can unravel undead and haunts. When he starts the performance and each round he maintains it, all haunts and undead creatures within 30 feet take positive energy damage equal to 1d6 + the Ashavic dancer&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. A successful Will save negates this damage.<br /><br /><em>Untethering Steps (Su)</em>: At 3rd level, an Ashavic dancer can use his performance to hinder one or more undead creatures within 30 feet to which the dancer has line of sight. For every 2 class levels the Ashavic dancer has attained beyond 3rd, he can target one additional creature. Each round he maintains the performance, the Ashavic dancer attempts a Perform (dance) skill check and compares the result to all of the targets&rsquo; CMD scores. Any target whose CMD is equaled or exceeded by the result of the Perform (dance) check becomes sickened by the dancer&rsquo;s movements for 1 round. Any target with a CMD that is exceeded by 10 or more also becomes staggered for 1 round.<br /><br /><em>Soothing Performance (Su)</em>: At 6th level, an Ashavic dancer gains the soothing performance bardic performance.<br /><br /><em>Exorcist&rsquo;s Waltz (Su)</em>: At 7th level, an Ashavic dancer can use his Ashavic performance to attempt to end an ongoing compulsion or possession effect. Using this ability requires 4 rounds of consecutive performance, and the target must be able to see the dancer perform and be within 30 feet. If the target is possessed, the target gains a new saving throw to end the possession effect; otherwise, this functions as break enchantment, using the Ashavic dancer&rsquo;s caster level for the effect. Any possessing entity cast out in this manner cannot attempt to possess that target again for 24 hours.<br /><br /><em>True Spark&rsquo;s Guidance (Su)</em>: At 10th level, an Ashavic dancer can lure the dead back into their graves. He can target one undead creature within 60 feet each round he maintains this performance&mdash;the targeted undead can resist the effects with a successful Will save. If the creature first became undead within the affected area, or if an open grave under the effects of hallow or consecrate is in the area, the undead takes a &ndash;4 penalty on this saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the target&rsquo;s speed is halved for 1 round (this includes all forms of movement such as f ly or swim). If the undead fails its save, it immediately takes 10 points of damage per class level of the Ashavic dancer and is staggered for 1 round, and it takes a &ndash;4 penalty on future saving throws against this performance for 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong>Ashavic Rites (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, an Ashavic dancer&rsquo;s mind-affecting Ashavic performances overcome an undead creature&rsquo;s immunity to mind-affecting effects, even if the undead is mindless. While maintaining any Ashavic or bardic performance, he can spend 1 additional round of the performance when he casts a mind-affecting spell to allow that spell to overcome an undead creature&rsquo;s immunity to mind-affecting effects as well.<br /><br /><strong>Peerless Dancer (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an Ashavic dancer gains versatile performance, as per the bard class feature. He must choose Perform (dance) as his Perform skill with this ability. If he had versatile performance in Perform (dance) before adding his first level in this prestige class, he gains Skill Focus (Perform [dance]) as a bonus feat instead.<br /><br />At 6th level, an Ashavic dancer chooses one of the following skills and adds it to the list of skills that are associated with Perform (dance) for the purpose of versatile performance: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive. He chooses a second skill at 8th level and a third skill at 10th level.<br /><br /><strong>Ghostly Grace (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, during an Ashavic dancer&rsquo;s Ashavic performance, all weapon attacks he makes are treated as if they had the ghost touch weapon special ability, and his spells have their full effect against incorporeal creatures, as per the Ectoplasmic Spell<sup>APG</sup> feat. At 9th level, allies within 30 feet also receive these benefits during his Ashavic performance.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sQNlH0aJ05b2NDmr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ashavic Performance (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Jzcrcb7S2tYQuUfW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ashavic Rites (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.foQF3GzAuD6rbRgC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Ghostly Grace (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":4,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FrA9Nf4RAYcfHAv6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Peerless Dancer (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kfjvecT5RkqB3pOK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Performance: Deathwaking Dance (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.dorrrwtLoTrUc6tK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Performance: Exorcist's Waltz (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":7,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LtvwRsasfx7LgZib","dataType":"compendium","name":"Performance: Soothing Performance (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":6,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Cw4EdI7dpnXHVJ16","dataType":"compendium","name":"Performance: True Spark's Guidance (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":10,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ggtHUXQFE0McVlY3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Performance: Untethering Steps (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/acrobatic.jpg","level":3,"_index":8}]},"tag":"ashavicDancer","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Ashavic Dancer","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

and Heart as One (Ex)</strong>: If the heritor knight has the weapon training class feature, her heritor knight levels stack with her fighter levels for the purpose of that ability. In addition, heritor knight levels stack with fighter levels for the purpose of feat prerequisites.<br /><br /><strong>Savior of the Swallowed (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, as a standard action, a heritor knight can make a melee attack with a longsword against a creature that is physically restraining an ally. This includes grappling, pinning, swallowing whole, and similar effects (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion). Resolve the attack normally, but if the attack roll equals or exceeds the creature&rsquo;s CMD, the restraining effect is immediately ended.<br /><br /><strong>Heritor&rsquo;s Honor (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a heritor knight gains a bonus on Will saving throws that&rsquo;s equal to her Charisma modifier. The bonus from this ability doesn&rsquo;t stack with those from similar effects.<br /><br /><strong>Witches&rsquo; Woe (Sp, Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a heritor knight gains a bonus equal to half her class level on saves against hexes and curse effects. In addition, once per day, she can cast remove curse as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to her character level.<br /><br /><strong>Skyreaver (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, as a standard action, a heritor knight can make a melee attack with a longsword against a flying creature (regardless of its method of flight). Resolve the attack normally, but any damage dealt is halved; in addition, if the attack roll equals or exceeds the creature&rsquo;s CMD, the creature immediately stops flying and falls to the ground. For a number of rounds equal to the heritor knight&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, the target creature takes a &ndash;20 penalty on all of its Fly checks.<br /><br /><strong>Wraithwall (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, once per day as a standard action, a heritor knight can inspire allies within 30 feet. Allies inspired this way treat all armor they wear as having the <em>ghost touch</em> special ability. In addition, inspired allies gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels. This effect lasts for 1 minute.<br /><br /><strong>Mohrgbreaker (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, as a standard action, a heritor knight can make a melee attack with a longsword against an undead creature. Resolve the attack normally, but the creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + the heritor knight&rsquo;s level + her Charisma modifier) or lose all special attacks associated with its natural weapons or touch attacks for a number of rounds equal to the heritor knight&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.<br /><br /><strong>Mighty Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a heritor knight gains Vital Strike and Improved Vital Strike as bonus feats. Whenever the heritor knight makes a melee attack as a standard action, she can apply the effects of Improved Vital Strike to that attack. If she has Greater Vital Strike, she can apply that feat&rsquo;s effects instead.<br /><br /><strong>Reforged Heart (Su/Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, once per day, a heritor knight can cast <em>greater make whole</em> (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide 10</em>) as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to her character level.<br /><br /><strong>Image of Divinity (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a humanoid heritor knight&rsquo;s appearance changes to superficially resemble the Inheritor herself, although she is still recognizable to those who know her, and her statistics do not change. Nonhumanoids do not change in appearance in this way. Three times per day as a swift action, the heritor knight can touch a creature. If the touched creature is good-aligned, it regains 1d6 hit points per class level of the heritor knight; evil-aligned creatures instead take that amount of damage. If this ability heals the target, the target is also affected by <em>restoration</em>. If this ability damages the target, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the heritor knight&rsquo;s level + the heritor knight&rsquo;s Charisma modifier) or become staggered for a number of rounds equal to the heritor knight&rsquo;s Charisma bonus (minimum 1 round). Neutral-aligned creatures are unaffected.<br /><br /><strong>Redeemer of Undeath (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, as a standard action, a heritor knight can make a melee attack with a longsword against an undead creature. Resolve the attack normally, but if the attack hits and the undead was good-aligned in life, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the heritor knight&rsquo;s class level + her Charisma modifier) or be destroyed and redeemed of the evils of undeath, allowing the soul to reach a righteous afterlife. If the creature succeeds, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong>Freed by Blood (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, when an ally within 30 feet attempts a saving throw against a death, paralysis, or compulsion effect, the heritor knight can take up to 9 points of damage as an immediate action. The ally gains a sacred bonus on the saving throw equal to the damage taken. This ability must be used before the saving throw is rolled, and can be used three times per day.<br /><br /><strong>Sky Stride (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a heritor knight is constantly under the effects of air walk. When the heritor knight moves through the air, her steps appear to be supported by crimson cloth that appears beneath her feet. Activating or deactivating this ability is a free action.<br /><br /><strong>Unveiling Mistress (Su)</strong>: Once per day at 10th level, a heritor knight can emit an unveiling aura as a free action. The true form of any creature within 30 feet is revealed, although polymorph and similar physical effects are not removed (remaining visible as a ghostly overlay). This aura lasts for 1 minute.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.XiKmX8tAtsWYd75f","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wraithwall (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":4,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.I44kdcqmkNAE2C9x","dataType":"compendium","name":"Witches' Woe (Sp, Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eWz4TQZy8TaRliUV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unveiling Mistress (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":10,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.boXSmutqA6QNhPcZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Skyreaver (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.z7B2uA2TCROugzXc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sky Stride (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":10,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.g929lNmNwYEhT0vF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Skill and Heart as One (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.xmrHvKZg3YWfF8zT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Savior of the Swallowed (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.p1UI7pVRl5B0hyKK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Reforged Heart (Su or Sp)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":6,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IDk3ODe160EVD5Z1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Redeemer of Undeath (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":8,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ZZSDuSusHng6ZTTD","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mohrgbreaker (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":5,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SdHHuUjeOWaJJPYa","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mighty Strike (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":6,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.R6jOd0ccDpkUbafg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Image of Divinity (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":7,"_index":11},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YqNHTHTTWUwyTFW9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Heritor's Honor (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":2,"_index":12},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.OWtsIw4q78X0iJzu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Freed by Blood (Su)","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-gold.webp","level":9,"_index":13}]},"tag":"heritorKnight","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

It is in their blood and constantly at the forefront of their thoughts. The teachings of this once small, exclusive group of knights have inspired others, and now heroes all across Golarion take up swords in the name of these ideals. Most crusaders spend their time advancing the cause of the downtrodden, freeing the oppressed from tyranny and injustice, or helping the timid rise up in the face of evil, though their powers also make them suited for hunting down criminals, breaking the mental shackles of brainwashing and witchcraft, and destroying monsters that pierce the bravest hearts with fear.<br /><br />Crusaders may work alone, with others of their kind, or with other clerics and paladins of Iomedae. They tend to be rigorous in their discipline and have little tolerance for &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t believe in at least one of the four ideals of their order.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an Inheritor&rsquo;s crusader, a character must fulfill the following criteria:<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Lawful good.<br /><strong>Deity</strong>: Iomedae.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Iron Will.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Proficient in longsword, channel positive energy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Inheritor's Crusader's class skills are Craft, Diplomacy, Heal, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (nobility), Knowledge (religion), Profession, and Sense Motive.<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.8024%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.7058%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.9739%;\"><strong>Spells Per Day</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.8024%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.7058%;\">Champion of honor, aura of great courage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.9739%;\">+1 level of cleric or paladin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.8024%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.7058%;\">Destroyer of tyranny</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.9739%;\">+1 level of cleric or paladin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.61288%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.8024%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.82123%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.07635%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.63501%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.7058%;\">Sword against injustice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.9739%;\">+1 level of cleric or paladin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n<tr></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Inheritor&rsquo;s crusader prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Inheritor&rsquo;s crusaders gain no additional proficiency in weapons or armor.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At each level, the crusader gains new spells per day as if he had gained a level in cleric or paladin (depending on whether he has cleric or paladin levels). He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the crusader has levels in cleric and paladin, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Champion of Honor</strong>: An Inheritor&rsquo;s crusader follows a code of conduct identical to that of a paladin, with the same penalties. A crusader&rsquo;s class levels stack with paladin class levels for the purpose of determining the effects of the paladin&rsquo;s smite evil ability.<br /><br /><strong>Aura of Great Courage (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, the crusader gains an aura of courage equivalent to that of a 3rd-level paladin. If the crusader already has this ability, the aura&rsquo;s range increases to 20 feet.<br /><br /><strong>Destroyer of Tyranny (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a crusader can shatter the oppressive influence of others. Any creature targeted by a crusader&rsquo;s channel positive energy ability or lay on hands gains a new saving throw against any ongoing charm or compulsion effect upon him. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, this can also allow the target a new saving throw against effects brought on by the power of belief, intimidation, or trickery, even if not actually a charm or compulsion.<br /><br />A crusader under one of these effects can expend a use of channel energy or lay on hands to attempt another saving throw against the effect; he can do this once per round as a swift action, and may use this ability even if doing so is contrary to the charm or compulsion effect; for example, a crusader charmed to defend an enemy against his own allies can use this ability to break the effect and turn on the enemy who charmed him. The crusader may indirectly benefit from this ability; for example, if the aforementioned enemy asks the crusader to heal him with channel energy, all creatures in the area (including the crusader) may attempt new saving throws against the controlling effects.<br /><br /><strong>Sword Against Injustice (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a crusader may use his power to judge the guilty and absolve the innocent. As a standard action he may announce he is bringing Iomedae&rsquo;s judgment upon a target who is accused of a crime, lie, or other affront to justice; the crusader makes a melee attack with his sword against the target as part of this judgment. If the target is innocent of what he is accused, the attack stops just short of striking him, as if hitting an invisible wall; if the target is guilty, the attack automatically hits with a flash of white light. This attack requires no attack roll and cannot critically hit. If the target is protected by an effect that inhibits divinations (such as <em>mind blank</em>), the attack bounces off the target with an unpleasant metallic hiss, like quenching a red-hot blade in water. The crusader may use this ability once per day; each additional use beyond the first drains him, causing him to become fatigued. He cannot use this class ability if he is exhausted. He may expend a use of channel energy or lay on hands while activating this ability to prevent fatigue. Sometimes people wrongly accused of great crimes beg for the intercession of an Inheritor&rsquo;s crusader, knowing this power will exonerate them.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.EKld86QVM2zcdmCt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aura of Great Courage (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/trample.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.t4pDo4x810hgmqXu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Champion of Honor","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/trample.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.JKs63rktAY3nPzHV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Destroyer of Tyranny (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/trample.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.454QMOTS9PplkWQa","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sword Against Injustice (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/trample.jpg","level":3,"_index":3}]},"tag":"inheritorsCrusader","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Indeed, at Thassilon&rsquo;s outset&mdash;before the runelords seized control&mdash;the original incarnations of these seven schools of magic were not associated with sins at all, but rather with the seven virtues of rule. This original lore is all but lost, but within the city-states of Varisia (particularly in Magnimar), a small order of spellcasters seeks to reclaim the knowledge of those empowering virtues. With the might of virtuous runes, they protect their homes from the lingering evil of Thassilon and look to the guidance of Soralyon, the Mystic Angel, to aid them in their quest. These spellcasters have also come to believe that a runelord&rsquo;s return to power is practically an inevitable threat that must be prepared for and defended against.<br /><br />The role of a

&ldquo;glyph&rdquo; or &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; in its name to his class spell list.<br /><br /><strong>Virtuous Rune (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a runeguard can master a secret method of using one of the seven runes of Thassilonian magic in a beneficial way to aid himself or others. He must choose one of the seven virtues when he gains this ability, but can choose another at 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th levels; by 9th level, he has mastered all seven of the secrets of virtuous runes. A runeguard can use any of the virtuous runes that he has mastered in any combination per day, but no more times per day than his runeguard level overall. Using a virtuous rune is a standard action (unless otherwise indicated in the text) and provokes an attack of opportunity.<br /><br /><em>Charity</em>: A runeguard can use the rune of charity to transfer a single abjuration spell he has prepared or knows (if he&rsquo;s a spontaneous caster), along with the ability to cast it, to a willing creature by touch, as per imbue with spell ability, save that the recipient&rsquo;s Hit Dice do not limit options. The level of the spell being transferred can&rsquo;t exceed the runeguard&rsquo;s level &ndash; 1 (and thus a 1st level runeguard can only transfer a 0-level spells in this way). Once the spell is transferred, that spell slot remains unavailable to the runeguard until the creature that gained the spell casts it, at which point the runeguard regains access to the spell slot the next time he rests and prepares his magic.<br /><br /><em>Kindness</em>: When using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds, the runeguard can call upon the rune of kindness to restore double the normal amount of hit points he otherwise would have healed by treating deadly wounds. He need not expend uses from a healer&rsquo;s kit when treating deadly wounds in this manner, and using this rune does not count against the total number of times a creature can benefit from heaving deadly wounds treated in a day.<br /><br /><em>Generosity</em>: When using the aid another action, the runeguard can draw upon the rune of generosity and expend a prepared spell or spell slot as an immediate action to grant an ally an insight bonus on attack rolls, on skill checks, or to Armor Class equal to the level of spell expended. The bonus persists for a number of rounds equal to the runeguard&rsquo;s class level.<br /><br /><em>Humility</em>: When the runeguard gains the benefits of the aid another action from an ally, he can expend a prepared spell or a spell slot (for a spontaneous caster) as an immediate action to gain an insight bonus on attack rolls, on skill checks, or to Armor Class equal to the level of the spell expended. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the runeguard&rsquo;s class level.<br /><br /><em>Love</em>: By sacrificing a prepared spell or a spell slot (for a spontaneous caster), a runeguard can use the rune of love to form a close and powerful bond with a number of willing allies equal to the level of the spell or spell slot sacrificed. All allies to be affected must be within 30 feet at the time the rune is used. Until the next time the runeguard prepares spells (at which point he regains the sacrificed spell or spell slot), each ally can sense the general emotional state, health, and direction of any other ally bearing the rune (as per status), as long as they are on the same plane. If a spell slot of 5th level or higher is sacrificed, the link also grants a telepathic bond (as per the spell) that can&rsquo;t be dispelled. A character with the rune of love active gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.<br /><br /><em>Temperance</em>: By invoking the rune of temperance, the runeguard becomes immune to the effects of negative energy for 1 round per runeguard level. The runeguard can use this ability as an immediate action to gain immunity to the effects of a single negative energy effect as that effect targets him, but doing so leaves the runeguard staggered on his next action.<br /><br /><em>Zeal</em>: By invoking the rune of zeal as a swift action, the runeguard bolsters his spellcasting for 1 round. During this time, the runeguard gains a bonus on all concentration checks equal to his runeguard level, and he can enhance any spell he casts that round with the effects of any metamagic feat he knows, provided the metamagic feat only uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level.<br /><br /><strong>Rune Focus</strong>: At 3rd level, the runeguard adds 1 to the DCs of saving throws against glyph or symbol spells (any spell with &ldquo;glyph&rdquo; or &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; in its name) and spells that are language dependent that he casts. This bonus stacks with the bonuses from the Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus feats. At 7th level, the runeguard adds 2 to the DCs of saving throws against these spells that he casts.<br /><br /><strong>Sihedron Rune Mastery (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a runeguard can cast <em>permanency</em> as a spell-like ability once per day by drawing upon the power of the Sihedron rune. He must still provide the spell to be made permanent by other means, of course. Although a runeguard can use this ability once per day, he can only ever maintain a single spell effect, and upon using this ability, the previous permanent spell effect immediately ends.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Vh3QCBA3W76CzMoP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Virtuous Rune (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_22.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.o0aOkxFpFtTLfe15","dataType":"compendium","name":"Rune Focus","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_22.jpg","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.xVmTXd3bogxVCH9a","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sihedron Rune Mastery (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_22.jpg","level":10,"_index":2}]},"tag":"runeguard","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

proficiency with all simple weapons and with her Eldest&rsquo;s favored weapon. She gains no additional proficiency with armor or shields. <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day or Spells Known</strong>: At the indicated levels, when a new feysworn level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before taking the prestige class. She doesn't gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had levels in more than one spellcasting class before becoming a feysworn, she must choose to which class she adds the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Feymarked (Ex)</strong>: Upon death, a feysworn is immediately resurrected and transported to a location on the First World sacred to the Eldest the feysworn worships (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, the feysworn may be reincarnated instead). From that point forward, the character is held in her living state only by the Eldest&rsquo;s will. While the amount of service the Eldest demands in exchange varies, if at any point the Eldest becomes displeased enough to revoke this status, the feysworn is immediately and utterly destroyed, her soul energy permanently reabsorbed into the First World. Creatures slain in this manner cannot be resurrected short of deific intervention.<br /><br />Feysworn creatures are immune to any spell not capable of targeting fey (such as <em>dominate person, charm person, hold person</em>, and any other spells specifically targeting humanoids). This immunity can be voluntarily suspended as per the rules for spell resistance.<br /><br /><strong>Obedience (Ex)</strong>: A feysworn must select one of the Eldest to worship; once this choice is made, it can&rsquo;t easily be changed . In order to keep the abilities granted by this prestige class (including augmented spellcasting abilities), a feysworn must conduct a daily obedience to her chosen Eldest (see Chapter 2).<br /><br /><strong>Fey Boon</strong>: As a feysworn gains levels, she gains boons from her Eldest patron. The nature of the boons varies depending on the feysworn&rsquo;s chosen Eldest. Each Eldest grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the feysworn gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the Fey Obedience feat on page 17 and the Eldest descriptions in Chapter 2 for details on fey boons. When an Eldest grants a spell-like ability, the feysworn&rsquo;s level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a feysworn to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.<br /><br /><strong>Breacher (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a feysworn gains a constant and instinctive sense of the direction (though not distance) to the nearest breach between the First World and the Material Plane.<br /><br /><strong>Feyskinned (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a feysworn gains the ability to harden her skin, granting herself DR 10/cold iron for 1 minute per feysworn level each day. This duration need not be consecutive but must be used in 1-minute increments. At 7th level, this DR becomes constant. If the feysworn already has DR 10/cold iron or better, the damage reduction increases by 5.<br /><br /><strong>Summon Fey (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, a feysworn can use <em>summon monster IV</em> once per day to conjure 1 ekekeh (see page 60) or satyr, 1d3 nuglub gremlins (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 143</em>), or 1d4+1 fauns (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 114</em>). At 8th level, the feysworn also gains the ability to use <em>summon monster VIII</em> once per day to conjure 1 bogeyman (<em>Bestiary 3 42</em>), 1d3 nuckelavees (<em>Bestiary 3 203</em>), or 1d4+1 escorites (see page 61). At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, specific Eldest may allow feysworn who worship them to summon other fey creatures of equal power with this ability.<br /><br /><strong>Alien Mind (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, for a number of rounds per day equal to her feysworn level, the feysworn gains a +4 sacred bonus to one mental ability score and on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. These rounds do not need to be used consecutively. Once selected, the mental ability score affected cannot be changed until the feysworn next performs her Eldest&rsquo;s obedience. Activating or maintaining this ability is an immediate action.<br /><br /><strong>Plane Swap (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, the feysworn gains the ability to transport herself and up to one touched willing creature per feysworn level from the Material Plane to the First World or vice versa. This ability can be used once per day as a standard action, and functions as <em>plane shift</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Tear Reality (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, once per day as long as she is on the Material Plane or in the First World, the feysworn can rip the planar fabric to unleash terrible magical energies. The area of effect is always centered on her (though she may otherwise determine its shape or targets according to the spell&rsquo;s description) and chosen at random from the following spell effects.</p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d%</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spell</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-17</td>\n<td><em>Incendiary cloud</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18-34</td>\n<td><em>Sunburst</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35-51</td>\n<td><em>Earthquake</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>52-68</td>\n<td><em>Fire storm</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>69-85</td>\n<td><em>Storm of vengeance</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>86-100</td>\n<td><em>Reverse gravity</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Any level-based spell DCs and damage effects are based on the feysworn&rsquo;s total character level (not just her feysworn level). The feysworn herself is immune to the magical effects, but allied creatures are affected unless noted otherwise in the spell.<br /><br />This ripping of the planar fabric opens a breach to a random location on either the First World or Material Plane, allowing travel between the planes.

This is the only method by which she can switch her Eldest patron, and even this may not be sufficient, as the Eldest are generally reluctant to take on unreliable servants.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.yPqtbKiMrKO0LvmM","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tear Reality (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":10,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AMyPR2CFSoyKY4dU","dataType":"compendium","name":"Summon Fey (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":4,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.L0poGhYw9HdOrW8P","dataType":"compendium","name":"Plane Swap (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NiiFLx2EBgHvkcYf","dataType":"compendium","name":"Obedience (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.VEe4FTvo4iJn1SxV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Feyskinned (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qh3cjL3mT4KjM2X5","dataType":"compendium","name":"Feymarked (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PkmBd7cAnfVyU5uc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Fey Boon","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.i2kROIOvTxt6rnOC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Breacher (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":2,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YbufiQZokxwani8Q","dataType":"compendium","name":"Alien Mind (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_24.jpg","level":5,"_index":8}]},"tag":"feysworn","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim"],"custom":"Eldest’s favored weapon"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":true,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Whenever possible, they follow in the literal footsteps of Nex by looking to the wizard-king&rsquo;s diary entries, workbooks, and scrolls (with such resources often being of questionable legitimacy). Seizing political power in the years immediately after his disappearance, the Arclords reinitiated hostilities with rival Geb while instituting laws and social policies derived from hoarded scraps of Nex&rsquo;s personal correspondence and journals. This behavior led to their ouster and exile from Nex.<br /><br />In the centuries since, most Arclords have pursued less radical methods of carrying out Nex&rsquo;s will. Arclords pioneered and refined the practical application of magical constructs, conjurations, and education, founding the legendary Arcanamirium in Absalom. In Quantium, the Arclords&rsquo; ancient exile is long since forgotten. The Arclords&rsquo; goal is as subtle as it is simple&mdash;to make themselves and their magic (and, in a broader sense, all magic) an indispensable and irreplaceable foundation of communities and societies across the face of Golarion. In this way, they have achieved positions of inf luence and leadership that eluded them when they tried to seize power directly, and their voice is loud and persuasive in courts throughout the Inner Sea.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an Arclord of Nex, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Craft Construct, Craft Wondrous Item, Eye of the Arclord (<em>The Inner Sea World Guide </em>286).<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Diplomacy 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: You must be able to cast <em>arcane sight</em>, and have at least two spells from every school of magic scribed in your spellbook.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Arcane school class feature. You must have the ability to use hand of the apprentice or a different arcane school power that you can use a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. For Arclord of Nex abilities that require you to expend a number of uses of hand of the apprentice, if you can&rsquo;t use hand of the apprentice you can substitute an equivalent arcane school power you can use a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

In addition, while the eye is open, the Arclord can use the aid another action to grant an adjacent wizard a +1 bonus to her caster level and a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks for the next wizard spell she casts before the beginning of the Arclord&rsquo;s next turn.<br /><br /><strong>Artificer&rsquo;s Touch (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, an Arclord of Nex can expend one use of his hand of the apprentice to use the Artifice domain&rsquo;s artificer&rsquo;s touch power, using his caster level as his cleric level.<br /><br /><strong>Scholiast (Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, an Arclord of Nex can access the wizard school powers of another school of magic. He chooses a single arcane school spell-like ability that has a number of uses per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. Henceforth, he may use that ability (with a wizard level equal to his caster level) by expending two uses of his hand of the apprentice ability. A specialist wizard needs to expend two uses of his equivalent ability if using scholiast for hand of the apprentice, but still has to expend one additional daily use (for a total of three) to use it for a power of a different school.<br /><br />At 6th level and again at 9th level, an Arclord of Nex can choose an additional arcane school spell-like ability to use with this ability.<br /><br /><strong>Arcane Architect (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, an Arclord of Nex can create constructs with the Craft Construct feat in only half the time it would normally take. In addition, he can apply the Extend Spell and/or Widen Spell metamagic feats to conjuration (creation) spells he prepares, even if he doesn&rsquo;t possess those feats. If he does possess them, the level increase for applying Extend Spell to a conjuration (creation) spell is eliminated, and the level increase for applying Widen Spell to a conjuration (creation) spell is reduced to 2.<br /><br /><strong>Improved Third Eye (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, an Arclord can activate his Eye of the Arclord feat as a move action. An Arclord of Nex can expend two uses of his hand of the apprentice ability to add the effect of <em>arcane sight </em>or <em>see invisibility </em>to the benefits of his Eye of the Arclord for 1 minute (or until the duration of the Eye ends, whichever is sooner). He can add both effects by expending four uses of this ability.<br /><br /><strong>Extradimensional Extension (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, the duration of any spell cast by an Arclord of Nex that creates an extradimensional space (or demiplane) or moves creatures or objects through the Ethereal Plane is doubled as though affected by the Extend Spell feat, without altering the level of the spell. Applications of Extend Spell do not stack with this ability.<br /><br /><strong>Call for Aid (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, as a standard action, an Arclord of Nex can sacrifice a prepared spell of 2nd level or higher to call a creature bound to him, including an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, personally controlled construct or undead creature, creature telepathically linked to him (including by <em>telepathic bond</em>, <em>dominate person</em>, or <em>dominate monster</em>), or an outsider bound with a <em>planar binding</em> spell. The named creature appears adjacent to the Arclord, or in the nearest open space if all adjacent squares are occupied. This ability functions like <em>greater teleport</em>, except the range limit is determined by the level of the sacrificed spell: short (2nd&ndash;3rd), medium (4th&ndash;5th), long (6th&ndash;7th), unlimited (same plane) (8th), or unlimited (any plane) (9th).<br /><br /><strong>Greater Third Eye (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, an Arclord can activate his Eye of the Arclord as a swift action. In addition, he can expend four uses of his hand of the apprentice while opening his third eye to gain <em>greater arcane sight </em>or <em>true seeing </em>until the beginning of his next turn. He gains both effects if he expends eight uses of this ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.kAyBtmoyrqzJVxeQ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Arcane Architect (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":4,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IMtR2qFe9q6kMPU1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Artificer's Touch (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AmlfJBXGQXCWXzQN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Call for Aid (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":8,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.srgFtHnmOS75NcX1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Extradimensional Extension (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":6,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.sLIlCIHYSEBpN694","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Third Eye (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":10,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pTEskaam7rtY0xIA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Third Eye (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.DMlr95khD8K18jE1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mystic Pedagogue (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NxKDrK81s0pokh0U","dataType":"compendium","name":"Third Eye (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":1,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.XkVXOND8Q1nta92s","dataType":"compendium","name":"Scholiast (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_29.jpg","level":3,"_index":8}]},"tag":"arclordOfNex","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Arclord of Nex","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Yet Gray Corsairs must also be able to operate with skill on land, for they are often expected to mount marine-based raids on island strongholds or other remote locations used by slavers as markets or staging areas for their cruelty.<br /><br />The Gray Corsairs existed for some time before the Eagle Knights officially formed. While they&rsquo;ve focused on fighting slavery from the start, they did so in their early days as true pirates rather than privateers. Their assimilation into the Eagle Knights as the naval arm of the Steel Falcons gave the organization a surprisingly strong presence in the Inner Sea, and with Andoran&rsquo;s direct support, these privateers have become a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The freedom fighters who take this prestige class exemplify the call to action to fight slavery in a more violent and aggressive manner than do their allies in the Bellflower Network, and they focus not on mainland slavery but upon the disruption of sea trade of slaves. Swift and agile combatants are in high demand on Gray Corsair ships, as are spellcasters with the ability to command elemental forces or magical transport, and the prestige class plays to this, offering such characters an opportunity to choose an area of specialty while bolstering their nautical skill and knack for rescuing slaves.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a Gray Corsair, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any nonevil. <br /><strong>Feat</strong>: Sea Legs<sup>UC</sup>. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Acrobatics 5 ranks, Profession (sailor) 5 ranks, Stealth 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: A senior Eagle Knight must invite the character into the organization.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Gray Corsair's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Dex), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Fly (Dex), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (engineering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Profession (sailor) (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">1st favored port, gray focus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">Gray boon, know the ropes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">2nd favored port, slaver slayer +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">Breathe easy 1/day, gray boon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">3rd favored port, grim resolve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">Gray boon, slaver slayer +4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">4th favored port, breathe easy 2/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">Gray boon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">5th favored port, grant freedom, slaver slayer +6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.03595%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5451%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.56611%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.31099%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.6723%;\">Breathe easy 3/day, gray boon, whisk to freedom</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Gray Corsair prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Favored Port (Ex)</strong> Gray Corsairs build alliances and friendships that last lifetimes among freed slaves and their families as a result of the organization&rsquo;s good work. A Gray Corsair can pick any coastal settlement as a favored port. While in that settlement, a Gray Corsair gains a +2 bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Knowledge (local) checks, as well as on initiative checks and Will saving throws. He need not pay for room and board in a favored port. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Gray Corsair can select another favored port. A Gray Corsair also gains his favored port bonuses when aboard any ship whose home port is one of his favored ports.<br /><br /><strong> Gray Focus</strong>: Gray Corsair training works best when synergizing with the powers and talents of a limited range of classes that are particularly well-suited to the seaborne life of rescuing slaves and defeating slavers. When a character gains his first level as a Gray Corsair, he must choose one of the following classes as his gray focus: bard, cleric, fighter, gunslinger, inquisitor, investigator, magus, mesmerist, psychic, rogue, swashbuckler, sorcerer, or wizard.<br /><br />If he chose a spellcasting class, the Gray Corsair automatically succeeds at any concentration checks required to cast a spell while being subjected to vigorous or violent motion while either swimming or on a ship.<br /><br />If he chose a non-spellcasting class, the Gray Corsair doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity as a result of moving through a threatened square while on a ship or while swimming, unless he chooses to do so.<br /><br />A Gray Corsair who has no levels in any of the above classes must still choose a class as his gray focus, but until he gains a level in that chosen class, he does not gain any benefit for his gray focus or gray boons (see below). Once he gains at least 1 level in his gray focus class, he immediately gains the appropriate powers and boons due him from his Gray Corsair class levels.<br /><br /><strong> Gray Boon</strong>: At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Gray Corsair gains some of the class features of the class he chose as his gray focus, provided he has at least 1 level in the class chosen.<br /><br />If his gray focus class is bard, cleric, inquisitor, magus, mesmerist, psychic, sorcerer, or wizard, he gains spells per day as if he&rsquo;d gained an additional level of the class chosen.<br /><br />If his gray focus class is fighter, gunslinger, or swashbuckler, he gains a bonus combat feat.<br /><br />If his gray focus class is investigator, he gains a +1d6 studied strike, as per the investigator class feature. This extra damage stacks with other sources of studied strike.<br /><br />If his gray focus class is rogue, he gains a +1d6 sneak attack, as per the rogue class feature. This extra damage stacks with other sources of sneak attack damage.<br /><br /><strong> Know the Ropes (Ex)</strong>: Gray Corsairs spend a lot of time in the rigging of their ships, as this affords them the best view. At 2nd level, while climbing ropes or rigging, a Gray Corsair gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Climb checks and needs only one hand free to do so. In addition, in such circumstances he doesn&rsquo;t take a penalty when using the accelerated climbing option, doesn&rsquo;t lose his Dexterity bonus to AC, and doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt a Climb check to avoid falling when he takes damage.<br /><br /><strong> Slaver Slayer (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Gray Corsair gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against targets he knows to be slavers or to own slaves. This bonus increases to +4 at 6th level and +6 at 9th level. A Gray Corsair automatically confirms critical hits against such targets.<br /><br /><strong> Breathe Easy (Sp)</strong>: Desperate slavers sometimes throw their living cargo overboard, so a Gray Corsair must help slaves stay alive until they can be plucked from the waves. At 4th level, a Gray Corsair can cast <em>water breathing</em> once per day as a spell-like ability (CL = the Gray Corsair&rsquo;s class level). The Gray Corsair can use this ability as a move action or an immediate action if he so chooses. When used as a move action, the ability can affect only one creature, but can do so at a range of 120 feet. When used as an immediate action, the ability can affect only one creature, but can do so at a range of 60 feet, and its duration is reduced to 1 minute per level. A Gray Corsair can use this ability twice per day at 7th level, and up to three times per day at 10th level.<br /><br /><strong> Grim Resolve (Ex)</strong>: A Gray Corsair has seen more suffering aboard a single slave ship than many will in their entire lives, but this only hardens his resolve&mdash;he knows all too well that there are fates worse than death. At 5th level, a Gray Corsair becomes immune to fear effects and adds his Wisdom bonus to attempts to stabilize when his hit points are reduced to below 0.<br /><br /><strong> Grant Freedom (Sp)</strong>: At 9th level, a Gray Corsair gains the effects of <em>freedom of movement</em> as a constant spell-like ability (his effective caster level equals his class level). As a swift action, he can transfer this effect to a creature by touch, but in this case the effect persists for only 1 minute per effective caster level. When he does so, he regains the benefits of this ability 24 hours later.<br /><br /><strong> Whisk to Freedom (Sp)</strong>: A Gray Corsair spends enough time harnessing the wind that he learns to become one with it. At 10th level, a Gray Corsair gains <em>wind walk</em> and <em>word of recall</em> as spell-like abilities (caster level 10th), each usable once per day. <em>Word of recall</em> must return the Gray Corsair to a Gray Corsair ship.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.uBDwUbHyKlGMTAWj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Whisk to Freedom (Sp)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":10,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rVgbJRQKdL8Qxx0S","dataType":"compendium","name":"Slaver Slayer (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.B9j7nJOZ8vna9geL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Know the Ropes (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2jUwnjSoddZ81yRP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Grim Resolve (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":5,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.RH2EKtf4DyBsQbyX","dataType":"compendium","name":"Gray Focus","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Wk4quiHmhXA2oVQ1","dataType":"compendium","name":"Gray Boon","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.NzFkRthJoZIlSyFg","dataType":"compendium","name":"Grant Freedom (Sp)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":9,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ObLvghHyt1YYufR4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favored Port (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.LcQNqDSEbKjyAwnD","dataType":"compendium","name":"Breathe Easy (Sp)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-brown.webp","level":4,"_index":8}]},"tag":"grayCorsair","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":true,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Those known as rose wardens serve as her champions, their elite skills contributing to the cause of revolution&mdash;yet they are not obvious crusaders who revel in personal fame or glory. Though they oppose despotic governments, they do not act as anarchists or criminals; for example, rose wardens try to prevent demonstrations from becoming destructive riots to avoid harming innocents.

The save DC of any saving throw called for by an insurgent technique is equal to 10 + the rose warden&rsquo;s class level + her Intelligence modif ier. Spell-like abilities have a caster level equal to the rose warden&rsquo;s class level.<br /><br /><em>Everbloom&rsquo;s Wrath (Sp)</em>: The rose warden selects either <em>chaos hammer</em> or <em>holy smite</em>. She can use that spell once per day as a spell-like ability. If a rose warden chooses this technique a second time, she gains the ability to cast the other spell once per day as well.<br /><br /><em>Holy Thorns (Su)</em>: Once per day as a swift action, the rose warden can cause thorns to magically sprout from her weapon. The weapon counts as good-aligned for purposes of overcoming DR. A lawful or evil target damaged by this weapon must succeed at a Fortitude save or be wracked with pain and become staggered for 1 round. The thorns dissipate after a number of rounds equal to the rose warden&rsquo;s class level.<br /><br /><em>Rogue Talent</em>: A rose warden can select one rogue talent for which she qualifies. Her rose warden levels stack with rogue levels for the purpose of any rogue talents she has with level-dependent effects, whether they were gained from this prestige class or another class.<br /><br /><strong>Liberated Mind (Su)</strong>: A rose warden gains a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist charm, compulsion, and fear effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level.<br /><br /><strong>Street Sentinel (Ex)</strong>: A rose warden gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when she is in an urban area. Whenever she is traveling in urban terrain, a rose warden leaves no trail and can&rsquo;t be tracked (though she can leave a trail if she chooses). At 6th level, this bonus increases to +4.<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt starts at +1d6 and increases by 1d6 every 2 levels (4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If a rose warden gets sneak attack bonuses from other sources, the bonuses on damage rolls stack.<br /><br /><strong>Voice of the Masses (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a rose warden&rsquo;s movement is not impeded by crowds, and she gains a bonus equal to her rose warden level on checks to inf luence crowds.<br /><br /><strong>Cunning Disarm (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a rose warden can use Sleight of Hand in place of a combat maneuver check to disarm a foe. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.<br /><br /><strong>Insurrectionist (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a rose warden can ignore impediments to her mobility. For a number of rounds per day equal to her rose warden level, she can move normally regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if she were affected by <em>freedom of movement</em>. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. In addition, once per day she can grant this ability to all allies within 30 feet. This effect occurs automatically as soon as it applies.<br /><br /><strong>Advanced Insurgent Technique</strong>: At 5th level, a rose warden can select one of the following advanced insurgent techniques in place of a normal insurgent technique.<br /><br /><em>Advanced Rogue Talent</em>: A rose warden can select one advanced rogue talent that she qualifies for. Her rose warden levels stack with rogue levels for the purpose of any advanced rogue talents she has with level-dependent effects, whether they were gained from this prestige class or another class.<br /><br /><em>Alleyport (Sp)</em>: Once per day as a swift action, the rose warden can teleport as per <em>dimension door</em>, but only when she is in an area no wider than her space, and she can arrive only in an area of similar width.<br /><br /><em>Small but Fierce (Ex)</em>: As a move action, the rose warden can study an opponent at least one size category larger than herself that she can see. She can then apply the precision damage granted by sneak attack on her next attack made in the same round she studied the larger foe, even if that target is not denied its Dexterity bonus to its AC.<br /><br /><em>Wall of Roses (Sp)</em>: Once per day, the rose warden can cast <em>wall of thorns</em> as a spell-like ability. The wall consists of a dense tangle of roses through which worshipers of Milani can pass with ease. The wall of roses heals at a rate of 5 hit points per round; it is immune to fire damage; and all piercing damage it deals bypasses damage reduction as if it were a good, magic, and silver weapon. Evil and lawful creatures damaged by a wall of roses automatically become sickened for the next minute (this is a poison effect).<br /><br /><strong>Obfuscate (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a rose warden can use the Stealth skill even while she is being observed. While she is in an urban area, a rose warden can hide in the open even without actually having anything to hide behind. <br /><br /><strong>Rallying Courage (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, a rose warden becomes immune to fear effects. Once per day as a swift action, she can inspire an ally affected by fear who is within her line of sight, allowing that ally to attempt a second saving throw against the condition.<br /><br /><strong>Smite Tyranny (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, when a rose warden deals sneak attack damage to a lawful or evil target, she can choose to smite tyranny as a free action. The rose warden deals an additional 2 points of damage per sneak attack die rolled to the target.

They are paragons of battle, eschewing sermons for steel. These men and women are living conduits of divine power, down to their very blood, which they happily shed in a moment if it brings greater glory to their deity or judgment upon heretics, infidels, and all enemies of the faith.<br /><br />Holy vindicators are usually clerics or fighter/clerics, though many paladins (or even paladin/clerics) are drawn to this class as well.

proficient with all simple and martial weapons and all armor and shields (except tower shields). <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a vindicator gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits of that class other than spells per day, spells known, and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If he had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a vindicator, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Channel Energy (Su)</strong>: The vindicator's class level stacks with levels in any other class that grants the channel energy ability. <br /><br /><strong>Vindicator's Shield (Su)</strong>: A vindicator can channel energy into his shield as a standard action; when worn, the shield gives the vindicator a sacred bonus (if positive energy) or profane bonus (if negative energy) to his Armor Class equal to the number of dice of the vindicator's channel energy. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until the vindicator is struck in combat, whichever comes first. The shield does not provide this bonus to any other wielder, but the vindicator does not need to be holding the shield for it to retain this power. <br /><br /><strong>Stigmata (Su)</strong>: A vindicator willingly gives his blood in service to his faith, and is marked by scarified wounds appropriate to his deity. He may stop or start the flow of blood by force of will as a standard action; at 6th level it becomes a move action, and at 10th level it becomes a swift action. Activating stigmata causes bleed damage equal to half the vindicator's class level, and this bleed damage is not halted by curative magic. While the stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator gains a sacred bonus (if he channels positive energy) or profane bonus (if he channels negative energy) equal to half his class level. Each time he activates his stigmata, the vindicator decides if the bonus applies to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, Armor Class, caster level checks, or saving throws; to change what the bonus applies to, the vindicator must deactivate and reactivate his stigmata. <br /><br />While his stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator ignores blood drain and bleed damage from any other source and can use <em>bleed </em>or <em>stabilize </em>at will as a standard action. <br /><br /><strong>Faith Healing (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, any <em>cure wounds </em>spells a vindicator casts on himself are automatically empowered as if by the Empower Spell feat, except they do not use higher spell level slots or an increased casting time. If the vindicator targets himself with a cure spell that affects multiple creatures, this ability only applies to himself. At 8th level, these healing spells are maximized rather than empowered. <br /><br /><strong>Divine Wrath (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, when a vindicator confirms a critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 1st-level spell or available 1st-level spell slot to invoke <em>doom </em>upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). The save DC is increased by +2 if his weapon has a &times;3 damage multiplier, or by +4 if it is &times;4. The vindicator can also use this ability in response to being critically hit, even if the attack incapacitates or kills the vindicator. <br /><br /><strong>Bloodfire (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, while a vindicator's stigmata are bleeding, his blood runs down his weapons like sacred or profane liquid energy; when he uses Channel Smite, the damage increases by 1d6, and if the target fails its save, it is sickened and takes 1d6 points of bleed damage each round on its turn. The target can attempt a new save every round to end the sickened and bleed effects. <br /><br /><strong>Channel Smite</strong>: At 5th level, a vindicator gains Channel Smite as a bonus feat. <br /><br /><strong>Versatile Channel (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a vindicator's channel energy can instead affect a 30-foot cone or a 120-foot line. <br /><br /><strong>Divine Judgment (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, when a vindicator's melee attack reduces a creature to &ndash;1 or fewer hit points, he may sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell or available 2nd-level spell slot to invoke <em>death knell </em>upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). As vindicators mete out divine judgment, this is not an evil act. The save DC increases by +2 if his weapon has a &times;3 critical multiplier, or by +4 if it is &times;4. <br /><br /><strong>Bloodrain (Su)</strong>: At 9th level, while his stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator's harmful channeled energy is accompanied by a burst of sacred or profane liquid energy, increasing the damage by 1d6. Creatures failing their saves against the channeled energy become sickened and take 1d6 points of bleed damage each round. Affected creatures can attempt a new save every round to end the sickened and bleed effects. <br /><br /><strong>Divine Retribution (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, when a vindicator confirms a critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 3rd-level spell or available 3rd-level spell slot to invoke <em>bestow curse </em>upon the target as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). The save DC increases by +2 if his weapon has a &times;3 critical multiplier, or by +4 if it is &times;4. The vindicator can also use this ability in response to being critically hit, even if the attack incapacitates or kills the vindicator.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.AxK4RyAZ6NF2kist","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bloodfire (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":5,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KFdSTyVzojbYIysE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bloodrain (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":9,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.77vml3kTsvyvHo7W","dataType":"compendium","name":"Channel Energy (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.j9Ni4BQTUWLNh0k4","dataType":"compendium","name":"Channel Smite","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":5,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4pS3fTxGrKhiRlvB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Judgment (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":7,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gO4gmVkxrc7Kwor0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Retribution (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":10,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lvHZh0Db4VK3jzx3","dataType":"compendium","name":"Divine Wrath (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":4,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.59JSdAjkvAaqG8yJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Faith Healing (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":3,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.BtBdlTU7FsUQRzyD","dataType":"compendium","name":"Stigmata (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":2,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tetq6l8e2mh0cm42","dataType":"compendium","name":"Versatile Channel (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":6,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zhdL3vktoC8T9KCS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Vindicator's Shield (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/weapon-focus.jpg","level":1,"_index":10}]},"tag":"holyVindicator","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","hvy","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Some of her worshipers seek her guidance in the starry skies, attuning themselves to the constellations of the Cosmic Caravan (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Occult Mysteries 36</em>). Beyond the stargazers&rsquo; interests in the heavens, though, they also train for the inevitable conf lict with demons. Pulura&rsquo;s bastion of worship in the Inner Sea region has traditionally been in the land of Sarkoris, which was consumed from within by the Worldwound at the advent of the Age of Lost Omens. Many of Pulura&rsquo;s worshipers perished during that disastrous invasion from the Abyss, but those who survived remained behind and, over the past several decades, have grown in power. This prestige class&rsquo;s specific defenses against demons and their ilk are a relatively recent addition to the traditions of the Puluran stargazer, but have served her worshipers well in helping them defend what little land they still control in the demon-blighted wastes of the Worldwound.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a stargazer, a character must

his stargazer level as his wizard level.<br /><br /><strong>Mystery Magic (Ex)</strong>: At 1st and 9th levels, the stargazer gains a hex from the witch&rsquo;s list of hexes. His stargazer levels count as (and stack with) witch levels when determining the effects of hexes. In addition, the stargazer adds all hexes available to a shaman with the heavens spirit (<em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 40</em>) to the witch list.<br /><br />At 3rd level, the stargazer gains the Stars<sup>ISG</sup> subdomain in addition to any domains he already has. His stargazer levels count as (and stack with) cleric levels when determining which domain abilities he gains and their effects. If he isn&rsquo;t a cleric, the subdomain&rsquo;s spells are added to his class spell list (if necessary) and to his spells known, spellbook, familiar, or similar source. Spells added this way may be cast only once per day, unless using the stars are right ability. He can use the stars are right ability regardless of his spellcasting class.<br /><br />A stargazer gains certain abilities from the heavens oracle mystery (<em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide 48</em>) as he gains levels as well. At 5th level, the stargazer gains the coat of many stars oracle revelation. At 7th level, he gains the star chart revelation. His stargazer levels and cleric levels count as (and stack with) oracle levels when he is determining the effects of these revelations.<br /><br /><strong>Sidereal Arcana (Su or Sp)</strong>: As he studies the skies, the stargazer binds himself to constellations from the Cosmic Caravan, drawing on their unearthly power. At 2nd level and every 2 class levels thereafter, the stargazer gains one sidereal arcana of his choice from the list below.<br /><br /><em>The Bridge</em>: The stargazer is warded against winter&rsquo;s darkness. He gains cold resistance 5 and darkvision with a range of 30 feet. The stargazer can see through darkness created by demons without penalty.<br /><br /><em>The Daughter</em>: The Daughter emboldens hearts with the promise of springtime and new life. The stargazer and allies within 10 feet gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear, and the DC to demoralize them via Intimidate increases by 4. The stargazer is immune to fear effects created by demons.<br /><br /><em>The Follower</em>: The specter of death follows the stargazer, shielding him from doom. The stargazer gains a +4 bonus on saves against death effects. In addition, he is immune to all death effects, negative energy effects, and negative levels created by demons.<br /><br /><em>The Lantern Bearer</em>: The stargazer&rsquo;s ability to conjure light increases. The radius of any light source he creates via magic increases by 10 feet, and its spell level is considered to be 2 higher.<br /><br /><em>The Mother</em>: The stargazer channels the nurturing heart of the Caravan. Whenever the stargazer casts a cure spell, casts breath of life, or uses the healing hex, he adds twice his class level to the hit points restored. If the stargazer is a cleric with channel positive energy, his stargazer levels stack with his cleric levels to determine its effects.<br /><br /><em>The Newlyweds</em>: The sign of intertwined lovers grants the stargazer a romantic mystique. Whenever he uses a charm or language-dependent effect against someone who could be romantically attracted to him, the save DC increases by 2. In addition, he gains a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against such individuals. Finally, the stargazer gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects created by demons.<br /><br /><em>The Pack</em>: The stargazer becomes attuned to the beasts that follow the Caravan. He gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks. In addition, whenever he casts a summoning spell that conjures multiple creatures of the animal type, he summons an additional animal of that type.<br /><br /><em>The Patriarch</em>: The stargazer gains an innate sense of direction. He always knows which way north lies, and gains a +4 bonus on skill checks made to navigate or find his way. The stargazer also becomes immune to maze and similar effects.<br /><br /><em>The Rider</em>: The stargazer can conjure a steed that deters those who would harm him. Once per day, the stargazer can use <em>phantom steed</em> as a spell-like ability; this spell-like ability has the light descriptor, and only the stargazer can ride the mount. The steed is made of starlight, and sheds light as a torch. While riding his star-steed, he is under the effects of <em>sanctuary</em> heightened to 4th level; if he breaks this sanctuary, he can reactivate it after 1 minute. The caster level of these effects is equal to his character level.<br /><br /><em>The Stargazer</em>: The constellation that shares his name warns the stargazer of danger. The stargazer gains a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks and is not considered flat-footed before he acts in combat, although this does not allow him to act if he could not otherwise do so.<br /><br /><em>The Stranger</em>: The stargazer learns to blend seamlessly into others&rsquo; cultures. He can use <em>cultural adaptation<sup>UI</sup></em> as a spell-like ability three times per day with a caster level equal to his character level. While under the effects of this ability, details of his body&rsquo;s appearance change as well, making him physically appear as the appropriate race or ethnicity (although his statistics do not change).<br /><br /><em>The Thrush</em>: The stargazer&rsquo;s voice becomes harmonious. The stargazer gains a bonus equal to half his class level on Diplomacy and Perform (sing) checks.<br /><br /><em>The Wagon</em>: The stargazer&rsquo;s movement becomes swift and steady. He gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his movement speed, and can take 5-foot steps in difficult terrain. In addition, three times per day as a swift action, he can gain the effects of <em>freedom of movement</em> for 1 round, but only against effects created by demons.<br /><br /><strong>Stars&rsquo; Dance (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, the stargazer&rsquo;s mastery of the Cosmic Caravan reaches its zenith. Once per day, the stargazer can replace one of his sidereal arcana with any other one. The new sidereal arcana can also be replaced using this ability, but the change is otherwise permanent.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SrtfHl1T6E8OVJUh","dataType":"compendium","name":"Guiding Light (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fire-arrows-sky-1.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pJRMUyQBl3rhDhgL","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mystery Magic (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fire-arrows-sky-1.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eGRZ9h4vBfTTg1BC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sidereal Arcana (Su or Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fire-arrows-sky-1.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tpRZByi1jHiEpF5g","dataType":"compendium","name":"Stars' Dance (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/fire-arrows-sky-1.jpg","level":10,"_index":3}]},"tag":"stargazer","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

She does not, however, gain any other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a diabolist, she must decide to which class she adds each level of diabolist for the purpose of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong> Damned (Ex)</strong>: When a diabolist is killed, her soul is instantly sent to Hell. A character attempting to resurrect her must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the diabolist&rsquo;s level or the spell fails. That character cannot attempt to resurrect the diabolist again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do so.<br /><br /><strong> Imp Familiar (Ex)</strong>: A diabolist forms a close bond with a particular imp, similar to how a wizard gains a familiar. This functions as the arcane bond wizard class feature, but as if the diabolist had selected the Improved Familiar feat. If a diabolist has class levels in another class that grants a familiar, levels in that class and her diabolist class levels stack for determining the overall abilities of her imp familiar. The imp familiar can communicate with its master via telepathy as long as the imp is in physical contact with her.<br /><br />At 5th level, the diabolist&rsquo;s imp familiar can choose any of the following spells to add to its list of at-will spell-like abilities: <em>bleed</em>, <em>deathwatch</em>, <em>detect evil</em>, <em>detect law</em>, <em>doom</em>, <em>ghost sound</em>, <em>mage hand</em>, <em>message</em>, <em>open/close</em>, or <em>prestidigitation</em>. The imp can also add any of the following spells to its list of 1/day spell-like abilities: <em>curse water</em>, <em>floating disk</em>, <em>grease</em>, <em>hold portal</em>, <em>identify</em>, <em>silent image</em>, <em>unseen servant</em>, or <em>ventriloquism</em>. The range of the imp&rsquo;s telepathy with the diabolist increases to 60 feet.<br /><br />At 8th level, the imp can choose two more at-will spell-like abilities from the corresponding list above, and it can choose one more 1/day spell-like ability from the corresponding list above. The range of the imp&rsquo;s telepathy with the diabolist increases to 1 mile.<br /><br /><strong> Infernal Charisma (Ex)</strong>: A diabolist gains a +2 bonus on Charisma checks to interact with devils. This bonus increases to +4 at 4th level and to +6 at 7th level.<br /><br /><strong> Obedience (Ex)</strong>: In order to maintain her diabolist abilities (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by the class), a diabolist must indulge her chosen patron with a daily obedience. This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the diabolist uses to regain spellcasting abilities (such as meditating, praying to an archdevil, or studying a spellbook). When a character takes her first level of diabolist, she must decide whether she is an evangelist, an exalted, or a sentinel of her diabolic patron. This choice determines which category of boons she earns as she gains levels, and once made, it cannot later be changed.<br /><br /><strong> Channel Hellfire (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a diabolist can alter spells that deal energy damage to instead deal hellfire damage (see page 136). She can do this as a free action a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Spells altered to use hellfire gain the lawful and evil descriptors.<br /><br /><strong> Infernal Bargain (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a diabolist making use of <em>planar ally</em> (or a similar spell) can attempt an opposed Charisma check against a called (but not summoned) devil. If she succeeds, the devil reduces the price it demands to serve her by half.<br /><br /><strong> Augment Summoning (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a diabolist gains the Augment Summoning feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.<br /><br /><strong> Diabolic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su)</strong>: As a diabolist gains levels, she gains boons from her infernal patron. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the diabolist&rsquo;s chosen patron and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each diabolic patron grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the diabolist gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the archdevil, infernal duke, and malebranche descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a diabolic boon grants a spell-like ability, the diabolist&rsquo;s caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a diabolist to access these boons earlier than normal; it doesn&rsquo;t grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.<br /><br /><strong> Heresy (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a diabolist gains a +2 bonus on checks to research specific devils&rsquo; sigils or true names. This bonus increases to +4 at 9th level.<br /><br /><strong> Hellish Soul (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, a diabolist has been deemed useful enough to the cause of Hell to be allowed a brief respite from damnation. If killed by any means outside of the will of Asmodeus, the archdevils, or another influential force in Hell, the diabolist can be resurrected as normal.<br /><br /><strong> Infernal Transport (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, a diabolist can transport herself through Hell in a burst of flames.

A Taldan viceroy on his way to the opera, bedecked in spectacularly gaudy evening attire complete with an exquisitely jeweled codpiece, is a far cry from a Qadiran princess in riding apparel of finest silk astride a priceless thoroughbred stallion.

(He gains 750 gp at 1st level, an additional 1,500 gp at 2nd level, and so on.)<br /><br /><strong>Greater Leadership (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, a noble scion gains the Leadership feat as a bonus feat. He can recruit a cohort up to one level lower than himself. At 10th level, he can recruit a cohort of the same level as himself.<br /><br /><strong>Aristocratic Erudition (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a noble scion gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level on Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), and Knowledge (nobility) checks. This ability also reduces the DCs of Diplomacy and Knowledge (local) checks others make to gather publicly known information about the noble scion by the same amount.<br /><br /><strong>Prestigious Influence (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a noble scion can use his inf luence to receive special treatment, favors, and other services. He effectively has a pool of virtual gold pieces equal to 150 gp plus 10 gp per class level to spend on services and non-material goods. This pool replenishes at the beginning of every week.<br /><br />Services and nonmaterial goods available to a noble scion include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay for lodgings, stabling, taxes, and tolls.</li>\n<li>Improve his lifestyle quality (<em>Core Rulebook </em>405).</li>\n<li>Hire entertainers, messengers, mounts, servants, transport, workers, and so on.</li>\n<li>Obtain invitations to exclusive events, or entry into privileged locations.</li>\n<li>Spread rumors or start a whispering campaign.</li>\n<li>Purchase spellcasting services.</li>\n<li>Employ an expert hireling to make a skill check with a check bonus of +10 plus his class level (50 gp).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp; A noble scion cannot permanently gain goods or wealth from this ability; boons attainable from this ability are generally only available in settlements of 5,000 people or more. The exact benefits available in a location are subject to GM discretion. <br /><br /><strong>Regional Expertise (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, and again at 6th and 8th level, a noble scion gains a bonus feat from one of the lists below, depending on where he is from. These feats must be taken from the same list at each level (except for feats under the &ldquo;general&rdquo; category, which can be taken by nobles from any region). A noble scion need not meet the prerequisites for these feats. At their discretion, GMs may add other feats to these regions or create lists for other regions.<br /><br /><em>Brevoy</em>: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword<sup>ISWG</sup>), Flanking Foil<sup>UC</sup>, Step Up, Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword<sup>ISWG</sup>).<br /><br /><em>Cheliax</em>: Careful Speaker<sup>ISWG</sup>, Enforcer<sup>APG</sup>, Intimidating Prowess, Skill Focus (Knowledge [planes]).<br /><br /><em>Jalmeray</em>: Improved Unarmed Strike, Skill Focus (Perform [dance]), Voice of the Sibyl<sup>UM</sup>, Weapon Focus (unarmed strike).<br /><br /><em>Kyonin</em>: Agile Maneuvers, Breadth of Experience<sup>APG</sup>, Skill Focus (Knowledge [nature]), Weapon Focus (longbow).<br /><br /><em>Nidal</em>: Blind-Fight, Diehard, Shadow Strike<sup>APG</sup>, Stealthy.<br /><br /><em>Osirion</em>: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (khopesh<sup>APG</sup>), Self- Sufficient, Skill Focus (Knowledge [history]), Weapon Focus (khopesh<sup>APG</sup>).<br /><br /><em>Qadira</em>: Animal Affinity, Quick Draw, Skill Focus (Appraise), Weapon Focus (scimitar).<br /><br /><em>River Kingdoms</em>: Improved Dirty Trick<sup>APG</sup>, Improved Steal<sup>APG</sup>, Ironguts<sup>APG</sup>, Skill Focus (Knowledge [local]).<br /><br /><em>Taldor</em>: Dazzling Display, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (falcata<sup>APG</sup>), Skill Focus (Bluff ), Weapon Focus (falcata<sup>APG</sup>).<br /><br /><em>Ustalav</em>: Combat Reflexes, Focused Discipline<sup>ISWG</sup>, Skill Focus (Knowledge [nobility]), Stoic<sup>ISWG</sup>.<br /><br /><em>General</em>: Acrobatic, Additional Traits<sup>APG</sup>, Alertness, Antagonize<sup>UM</sup>, Athletic, Cosmopolitan<sup>APG</sup>, Deceitful, Deft Hands, Fleet, Improved Initiative, Persuasive, Prodigy<sup>UM</sup>, Rhetorical Flourish<sup>UC</sup>, Run, Scholar<sup>ISWG</sup>.<br /><br /><strong>Dilettante Studies</strong>: At 5th level, a noble scion chooses two different dilettante studies from the list below. At 9th level, he again chooses two different dilettante studies to add to his repertoire. If either of these are duplicates of those chosen at 5th level, the bonuses stack.<br /><br /><em>Dilettante Performer (Su)</em>: A noble scion treats his effective bard level as two higher for the purpose of the bardic performance class ability. He must have the bardic performance class ability to choose this dilettante study.<br /><br /><em>Dilettante Scholar (Su)</em>: A noble scion gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class (see page 3).<br /><br /><em>Dilettante Scoundrel (Ex)</em>: A noble scion gains a +1d6 sneak attack bonus as per the rogue class ability. If a noble scion gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.<br /><br /><em>Dilettante Warrior (Ex)</em>: A noble scion gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.<br /><br /><strong>Servitor (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a noble scion gains a faithful NPC servitor of the same level as his cohort granted by the Leadership feat. This servitor can only have levels in NPC classes (<em>Core Rulebook </em>446) and comes equipped with gear appropriate for a character 1 level lower than the servitor&rsquo;s actual level. The servitor does not follow the noble scion as would a cohort or follower, but instead can run various errands for his master while the noble scion is adventuring, such as delivering messages or maintaining the scion&rsquo;s manor in his stead.<br /><br /><strong>Peerless Patrician (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, once per round a noble scion can roll twice on any Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (nobility), or Sense Motive check and take the better roll. Once per day, instead of rolling one of these skill checks, he can assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SRniUFY10TMMN9ir","dataType":"compendium","name":"Affluent (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-red-gold.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.K55GZrfuBteiHkGi","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Leadership (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-red-gold.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TVNMlZUmKtoMPkRd","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aristocratic Erudition (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-red-gold.webp","level":3,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8zAQPONEamtEK1wy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Prestigious Influence (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-red-gold.webp","level":4,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Gjh10KrGGOqAlEV8","dataType":"compendium","name":"Regional Expertise (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-red-gold.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.U23BBZ0CW4t36X91","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dilettante Studies","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-red-gold.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MVCEXuc0A45OjsBC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Servitor (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-red-gold.webp","level":7,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.mJEn67u9SBNixqjU","dataType":"compendium","name":"Peerless Patrician (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-red-gold.webp","level":10,"_index":7}]},"tag":"nobleScion","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","hvy","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

As a free action before attempting a Charisma check or Charisma-based skill check to interact with a genie, the genie binder can expend 1 point from her binding pool to add 1d6 to the result.<br /><br /><strong>Elemental Seal (Sp)</strong>: By expending 1 point from her binding pool, a genie binder can touch a creature or solid surface to create a powerful rune known as an elemental seal. At 1st level, a genie binder can create a seal of air. At 2nd, 3rd, and 4th levels, she learns how to create seals of earth, fire, and water, respectively. Creating an elemental seal requires a standard action, and placing it on an unwilling target requires a successful melee touch attack. An elemental seal is a writing-based magical effect whose caster level is equal to the genie binder&rsquo;s character level, and any associated saving throw is equal to 10 + the genie binder&rsquo;s class level + the genie binder&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.<br /><br />At 1st level, a genie binder can maintain only one elemental seal at a time. If she creates another seal beyond that limit, she chooses one of her seals to end immediately. Otherwise, an elemental seal lasts for 24 hours, and a genie binder can expend 1 point from her binding pool each day to extend the duration of an existing seal by 24 hours.<br /><br />An elemental seal has a different effect depending on whether it&rsquo;s placed on a genie, a non-genie creature, or a solid surface. If a genie binder places an elemental seal on a genie with a matching subtype (such as a seal of air on a djinni), the genie must succeed at a Will save or be affected by <em>charm monster</em> as long as the seal lasts.<br /><br />If a genie binder places an elemental seal on a non-genie creature, that creature gains several constant benefits, including resistance 10 to one energy type based on the seal&rsquo;s element. A seal of air grants electricity resistance and <em>feather fall</em>. A seal of earth grants acid resistance and <em>barkskin</em>. A seal of fire grants fire resistance and causes one weapon the creature wields to gain the <em>flaming</em> weapon special ability. A seal of water grants cold resistance, <em>freedom of movement</em>, and <em>water breathing</em>. At 5th level, the granted energy resistance increases to 20.<br /><br />When placed on a solid surface, an elemental seal functions as a <em>glyph of warding</em>. The seal can duplicate only the effects of a blast glyph and deals a specific type of damage based on the seal: acid (seal of earth), cold (seal of water), electricity (seal of air), or fire (seal of fire). <br /><br /><strong>Genie Mastery (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a genie binder must decide whether to bind a genie minion or pursue spellcasting power. Once this decision is made, it can&rsquo;t be changed. If she selects a genie minion, she gains an eidolon with the genie subtype, treating her genie binder level as her effective summoner level; her genie binder levels stack with any summoner levels she has for this purpose, but only for an eidolon with the genie subtype. If she selects spellcasting, she gains the benefits of her aligned spellcasting class feature (see below) at 3rd level, in addition to the other indicated levels.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, a genie binder gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a genie binder, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Genie Summoner (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a genie binder adds several types of genie to the creatures she can summon using the indicated <em>summon monster</em> spells: djinni (<em>summon monster V</em>), efreeti or shaitan (<em>summon monster VI</em>), or marid (<em>summon monster VII</em>). Each time she summons a genie in this way, she must expend 1 point from her binding pool, and summoned genies cannot cast <em>wish</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Extra Seal (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a geniebinder can maintain up to two elemental seals at a time. At 5th level, she can maintain up to three elemental seals. <br /><br /><strong>Unstoppable Seal (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, when placing an elemental seal on a genie, the genie binder can expend 1 point from her binding pool to increase the saving throw DC to resist the effect by 2.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Zsc9ARNXasHV9npk","dataType":"compendium","name":"Binding Pool (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_25.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zQ2c1v3t7F5EeL2u","dataType":"compendium","name":"Elemental Seal (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_25.jpg","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1Hteq4tJ9pOEsmEP","dataType":"compendium","name":"Extra Seal (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_25.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1DVYEdO4iTGhYCUZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Genie Mastery (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_25.jpg","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.G47fLAfYbmJDyTLT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Genie Summoner (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_25.jpg","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YHqpxygbqUnQcYec","dataType":"compendium","name":"Unstoppable Seal (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/violet_25.jpg","level":5,"_index":5}]},"tag":"genieBinder","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

But not all Qadiran mages see genies as creatures to be bested and enslaved. Instead of potential slaves, these <em>daivrat</em> (&ldquo;brothers of genies&rdquo;) treat genies as powerful allies, wise counselors, and comrades-in-arms. Though few are foolish enough to consider liberating the thralls of the emperor, each daivrat considers herself a soldier, servant, or cousin to the genies.<br /><br />Many are the names of the genies, and so similar that most cannot discern them. Yet the daivrat knows a djinni from a janni and the difference between a half-janni and a suli-janni. The daivrat is distinctly Qadiran, for no other land in Avistan or Garund has such a tradition of treating with the genie races. Good and neutral-aligned genies welcome a daivrat as a friend, and even hateful efreet know they can rely on their daivrat &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; sometimes to the daivrat&rsquo;s detriment.<br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Daivrat fill the same role as standard spellcasters, plus they are effective as diplomats among the genie races and those allied with genie-kind.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Daivrat are respected by genies for their willingness to treat them as equals rather than potential slaves. They are never evil.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>In order to qualify to become a daivrat, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.<br /><br

proficiency with any weapon or armor.<br /><br /><strong>Spells</strong>: At the indicated levels, a daivrat gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a daivrat, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Elemental Focus (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, the daivrat gains a measure of connection with elemental powers. Choose one of the following descriptors: acid, air, cold, earth, electricity, fire, or water. When casting spells of the chosen descriptor, the daivrat is considered to possess the Spell Focus feat for that spell. Only one Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus applies to the casting of a spell.<br /><br /><strong>Genie-Tongue</strong>: A daivrat is well-versed in communicating with genies and genie-kin. A daivrat gains a +2 bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence the attitudes of genies and allies of genies, and a +4 bonus to Knowledge checks regarding genies.<br /><br /><strong>Spell-Fetch (Su)</strong>: Once per day, while preparing spells (or spell slots, for spontaneous casters), a daivrat can conjure a minor genie to find an unusual spell for him. The daivrat chooses one spell he does not know, such as a spell from a prohibited school or from another class&rsquo;s spell list, and sends the genie to fetch magical energy matching that spell. The genie returns after 10 minutes and presents the daivrat with the matching spell energy.<br /><br />If the daivrat casts spells like a wizard, for the next 24 hours he can prepare the fetched spell as if it were in his spellbook. If he casts spells like a sorcerer, for the next 24 hours he may cast the fetched spell as if he knew it.<br /><br />At 2nd level, the genie can retrieve any spell of 3rd level or lower. At 5th level, the genie can retrieve any spell of 6th level or lower. At 8th level, the genie can retrieve any spell of 8th level or lower. The genie is incorporeal and has no other powers or abilities (it cannot be used to scout, send messages, and so on) and vanishes once it delivers the spell.<br /><br />Preparing or casting the fetched spell is more difficult than using spells the daivrat actually knows. If the fetched spell is on the daivrat&rsquo;s spellcasting class&rsquo;s spell list, it is treated as 1 spell level higher than normal; otherwise it is treated as 2 spell levels higher than normal.<br /><br /><strong>Genie&rsquo;s Friend (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a daivrat gains a +2 bonus to his caster level when conjuring genies. At 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.<br /><br /><strong>Elemental Attunement (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, the daivrat gains energy resistance 5 against acid, cold, electricity, or fire.<br /><br /><strong>Zhyen Familiar</strong>: At 6th level, a daivrat can select a zhyen (see the Bestiary chapter) to serve as his familiar, replacing any familiar he already possesses, as if he had the Improved Familiar feat.<br /><br /><strong>Greater Elemental Focus (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, the daivrat&rsquo;s connection with his chosen element deepens.

Grace<sup>UI</sup> as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites.<br /><br /><strong>Starsong (Su)</strong>: A sphere singer is able to use Perform (sing) to create magical effects, as per the bardic performance bard class feature. She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to twice her sphere singer level, and can also use rounds of bardic performance gained from bard levels to perform starsong performances, and vice versa. Starting a starsong performance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. If the sphere singer has bardic performance, she can also start bardic performances as a move action instead of a standard action. A starsong performance cannot be disrupted, but ends immediately if the sphere singer is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, silenced, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A starsong performance counts as a bardic performance for the purpose of determining how many performances the sphere singer can have in effect at one time. A starsong performance has audible components but not visual components. At 7th level, a sphere singer can start a starsong performance or a bardic performance as a swift action. The save DC against a sphere singer&rsquo;s performance is equal to 10 + the sphere singer&rsquo;s level + her Charisma modifier.<br /><br />The sphere singer&rsquo;s performances grow stronger as her level increases.<br /><br /><em>Wanderer&rsquo;s Hymn</em>: At 1st level, the sphere singer can use music to hasten her steps. As long as she maintains this starsong performance, she gains a +30- foot enhancement bonus to her base land speed.<br /><br /><em>Sweet Dreams</em>: At 3rd level, the sphere singer can spend 5 minutes performing and expend 5 rounds of starsong to protect sleepers. Any creature that remains within 30 feet of the sphere singer during the entire 5 minute performances becomes immune to <em>nightmare</em> and other effects that attack a sleeping target, such as a night hag&rsquo;s dream haunting ability, for one night&rsquo;s rest. In addition, those creatures gain the benefits of <em>dream feast</em> (<em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 232</em>).<br /><br /><em>Butterfly</em>: At 5th level, the sphere singer&rsquo;s music lets her explore the skies. While she maintains this starsong, she gains the benefits of <em>fly</em>. Alternately, by spending 5 minutes performing and expending 10 rounds of starsong performance, she can gain the benefits of <em>overland flight</em>. Both of these effects manifest at a caster level equal to the sphere singer&rsquo;s total Hit Dice. While under either effect, the sphere singer grows large butterfly wings.<br /><br /><em>Guide My Steps</em>: At 7th level, the sphere singer learns to use song as a guide to her goal. To use this starsong, she must spend 3 rounds performing and expend 6 rounds of starsong performance. At the end of this performance, the sphere singer gains the benefits of <em>find the path</em> at a caster level equal to her character level.<br /><br />If the sphere singer chooses, she can perform guide my steps without a clear destination in mind. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, the sphere singer may be guided to something particularly interesting, such as a new romantic opportunity, a good place to watch the sunset, or an exotic monster&rsquo;s den; otherwise, she merely wanders aimlessly until the effects end.<br /><br /><em>Fortune&rsquo;s Favor</em>: At 9th level, the sphere singer&rsquo;s song is so lively and delightful that Desna herself takes notice, blessing her with peerless luck. While she maintains this starsong, whenever the sphere singer rolls a d20 (but no more often than once per round), she can roll twice and take the more favorable result.<br /><br /><strong>Versatile Performance (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd and 6th levels, the sphere singer gains versatile performance, as per the bard class feature. The sphere singer can choose only Perform (sing) or Perform (dance); once she has already chosen both of these, she can instead gain any other versatile performance. When the sphere singer gains this ability, she can retrain ranks in the associated skills at no cost.<br /><br /><strong>Wandering Dream (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, the sphere singer gains Lucid Dreamer<sup>OA</sup> as a bonus feat. Each night as she sleeps, she can contact a single person. This functions as dream, except that the sphere singer must be very familiar with the recipient. Many sphere singers keep contact with distant family or lovers this way. At 6th level, this effect allows the recipient to enter the sphere singer&rsquo;s dreamscape, as per <em>dream council<sup>OA</sup></em> (as if the recipient had cast <em>dream</em> in response).<br /><br />At 8th level, instead of contacting a familiar person, the sphere singer can travel to a creature&rsquo;s dream and leave a suggestion. This functions as <em>demand</em>, but modifying <em>dream</em> instead of <em>sending</em>. When used this way, the normal restrictions on <em>dream&rsquo;s</em> recipient apply. The sphere singer chooses which of these abilities to use (if any) when she goes to sleep.<br /><br /><strong>Tapestry Traveler (Ex, Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, the sphere singer transcends mortality like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, her essence infused with stardust and unearthly energies. Her type changes to fey, and she grows large butterfly wings, gaining a fly speed of 50 feet (good). In addition, she becomes immune to cold and gains the no breath universal monster ability.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pwFrLMc2wnhUWJDm","dataType":"compendium","name":"Graceful Hand (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WOBXnXfbVyLxLSj0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Starsong (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.z5Z9FSkXIYrS57DE","dataType":"compendium","name":"Starsong: Butterfly","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hQ1ntJonBagfPClz","dataType":"compendium","name":"Starsong: Fortune's Favor","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":9,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pwnTLYX36N1OYAdJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Starsong: Guide My Steps","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":7,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.k2Frraa4B2U1t08r","dataType":"compendium","name":"Starsong: Sweet Dreams","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.dC5N50SGXKhlLslB","dataType":"compendium","name":"Starsong: Wanderer's Hymn","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":1,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.h1i4ci8kc4vBAeJy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tapestry Traveler (Ex, Sp)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":10,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.7KMrcBh8O7UFNiZD","dataType":"compendium","name":"Versatile Performance (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":2,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ErIgjXWXY0RqXL66","dataType":"compendium","name":"Wandering Dream (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-water.webp","level":4,"_index":9}]},"tag":"sphereSinger","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

This can be anything from bribing a foreign noble with inside information, to breaking the chains of the enslaved, to orchestrating widespread rebellion in an unfriendly land. While they occasionally serve as envoys and diplomats, Steel Falcons must be skilled at a variety of techniques if they expect to survive in hostile lands and accomplish their missions. The ability to utilize traps is as important to the Steel Falcon as the camaraderie she shares with her fellows. And while manipulating an enemy&rsquo;s emotions and seeking diplomatic solutions can solve some problems, others present no solution other than battle.<br /><br />Among the Eagle Knights, Steel Falcons have a reputation for being egotistical and self-aggrandizing. While the Steel Falcons are regarded as the faces and voices of the Andoren people by most non-Andorens, the perception that they are braggarts is more often than not the result of cordial rivalry among the branches. Steel Falcons, while occasionally braggadocios, are more aptly characterized by their shared zeal, dedication, selflessness, and diplomatic acumen. They are certainly aware of their reputation among the other branches of the Eagle Knights, but bear this knowledge stoically and patiently, knowing that all three branches of the group are necessary to ensure Andoran&rsquo;s continued success&mdash;they do not hold grudges.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To become a Steel Falcon, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong> Alignment</strong>: Any good. <br /><strong>Feat</strong>: Iron Will. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Diplomacy 5 ranks, Knowledge (history) 2 ranks, Knowledge (local) 2 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks. <br /><strong>Special</strong>: A senior Eagle Knight must invite the character into the organization.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Steel Falcon's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 4 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Enemy of slavers +2, heart of freedom, sailor and survivalist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Luck of the eagle 1/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Heroic speech, natural trap 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Comrade&rsquo;s bond 1/day, superior aid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Enemy of slavers +4, subtle manipulator, Talmandor&rsquo;s blessing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Chainbreaker, natural trap 2, luck of the eagle 2/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Comrade&rsquo;s bond 2/day (swift)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Talmandor&rsquo;s fury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Enemy of slavers +6, natural trap 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.49749%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.8488%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 7.44879%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.19367%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.4451%;\">Comrade&rsquo;s bond 3/day (free), luck of the eagle 3/day</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are features of the Steel Falcon prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Enemy of Slavers (Ex)</strong>: From the start, the Steel Falcon focuses much of her training on how to interact with slavers, both in combat and in diplomatic confrontations. A Steel Falcon gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against slavers and slave owners. Likewise, she gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. At 5th level, this bonus increases to +4, and at 9th level it increases to +6. This is treated as a favored enemy bonus. If the Steel Falcon has a favored enemy bonus from another class and her target is a slaver as well as a favored enemy of another type, the bonuses do not stack, and she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.<br /><br /><strong> Heart of Freedom (Ex)</strong>: A Steel Falcon gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion effects and attempts to possess her body or mind.<br /><br /><strong> Sailor and Survivalist (Ex)</strong>: A Steel Falcon adds her class level to Profession (sailor) checks and Survival checks to get along in the wild and navigate in the wilderness.<br /><br /><strong> Luck of the Eagle (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, once per day, a Steel Falcon can reroll any one d20 roll before she learns the result of that roll, but she must take the new roll, even if it is lower. At 6th level, the Steel Falcon can use luck of the eagle twice per day, and at 10th level, she can do so three times per day.<br /><br /><strong> Heroic Speech (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Steel Falcon can inspire her allies with tales of greatness, heroism, and the ideals of Andoran. This functions like the inspire courage aspect of bardic performance, treating the Steel Falcon&rsquo;s class level as her bard level when determining the effect; if the Steel Falcon has levels in bard, her class levels stack with her bard levels when determining the effect of this ability and the effect of her inspire courage bard ability. The Steel Falcon can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her class level + her Charisma modifier.<br /><br /><strong> Natural Traps (Ex)</strong>: As part of their guerilla warfare activities, Steel Falcons learn how to use the natural environment to create traps. At 3rd level, the Steel Falcon gains Learn Ranger Trap<sup>UM</sup> as a bonus feat (she does not need to meet the feat&rsquo;s normal prerequisite of 5 ranks in Survival). As per the rules for that feat, she learns one extraordinary ranger trap (chosen from the following: alarm trap, burning trap, exploding trap, fire trap, marking trap, poison trap, snare trap, and swarm trap). At 6th level, the Steel Falcon learns a second trap, and at 9th level she learns a third trap. The number of times she can use a trap is equal to her class level + her Wisdom bonus.<br /><br /><strong> Comrade&rsquo;s Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a Steel Falcon&rsquo;s love of freedom and hatred of slavery are so great that she evokes similar feelings in her companions. Once per day as a move action, she can grant her allies half her enemy of slavers bonus against all appropriate targets in sight; the allies must be within 30 feet and able to see or hear her. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Steel Falcon&rsquo;s Charisma bonus (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses her allies have; they use whichever bonus is higher. At 7th level, the Steel Falcon can use comrade&rsquo;s bond twice per day, and activating it is a swift action. At 10th level, she can use this ability three times per day, and activating it is a free action.<br /><br /><strong> Superior Aid (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, when performing the aid another action, a Steel Falcon grants a +4 bonus on the ally&rsquo;s attack roll or to the ally&rsquo;s Armor Class instead of the normal +2.<br /><br /><strong> Subtle Manipulator (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, if the Steel Falcon spends a full-round action studying a target, she can attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the target&rsquo;s Will save. If she succeeds, she gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against that opponent for a number of days equal to her Wisdom modifier. This ability can be used on a given target once per day, and a successful use resets its duration.<br /><br /><strong> Talmandor&rsquo;s Blessing (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a Steel Falcon gains the blessing of Talmandor, the avoral patron of Andoran. She gains a +10 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to make high or long jumps, a +4 bonus on Perception checks, and the benefits of <em>feather fall</em> at all times. If this effect is dispelled, you can reactivate it as a move action.<br /><br /><strong> Chainbreaker (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a Steel Falcon&rsquo;s attacks against bindings, chains, and manacles bypasses up to 10 points of hardness. This includes weapons with chains (such as flails, nunchaku, and spiked chains), a kyton&rsquo;s armor and weapons, chains animated by <em>animate objects</em>, and so on. The Steel Falcon also gains a +10 bonus on all checks to escape bindings with manacles or ropes.<br /><br /><strong> Talmandor&rsquo;s Fury (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, once per day as a standard action, a Steel Falcon can channel her rage at the injustice in the world, transforming her countenance into a terrifying display of righteous fury, giving her a fear aura with a range of 30 feet. Enemies within this radius are affected by a <em>fear spell</em> (CL 10th, Will DC 15 + the Steel Falcon&rsquo;s Charisma bonus). All other creatures in the area (including the Steel Falcon) are bolstered by the Steel Falcon&rsquo;s wrath and can immediately attempt new saving throws against any charm, compulsion, or possession effects currently affecting them. The Steel Falcon can use this ability if she is conscious, even if paralyzed or under the effect of a charm, compulsion, or possession that affects her judgment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Knq0NLW6iOqv3KhR","dataType":"compendium","name":"Chainbreaker (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":6,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ryStq3E72b0ENqWS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Comrade's Bond (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":4,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.l8MAdB7OvusCjbXY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Enemy of Slavers (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WNua4tW9eCTwRzmT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Heart of Freedom (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.O6hbHICweSxh0y7Z","dataType":"compendium","name":"Heroic Speech (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":3,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.l93MhDcVXDMZdjQF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Luck of the Eagle (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":2,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.r7GARd2nWqcsODuV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Natural Traps (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":3,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lWeHQQo3mVBKSuzC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sailor and Survivalist (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":1,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.v65MtgBZiOUOTJxu","dataType":"compendium","name":"Subtle Manipulator (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":5,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tgEObk0nFqZPZYFd","dataType":"compendium","name":"Superior Aid (Ex)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":4,"_index":9},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.iyxcqRZc8HNtgMSA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Talmandor's Blessing (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":5,"_index":10},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.IHezFD47xEMDdHg6","dataType":"compendium","name":"Talmandor's Fury (Su)","img":"icons/commodities/biological/wing-bird-white.webp","level":8,"_index":11}]},"tag":"steelFalcon","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

They focus their obsessive research on blackfire. This eldritch phenomenon burns away the fibers of reality wherever it touches, thinning the walls between planes&mdash;especially between the Material Plane and the dark and unholy pits of the evil Outer Planes. Some pursue blackfire for purely academic purposes, but most seek to harness and wield its energy to loose the destructive power of the multiverse upon all creation.<br /><br />The Riftwardens diametrically oppose the Blackfire Adepts. While Adepts seek to harness the might of the evil Outer Planes for their own, constantly opening planar gateways in hopes of catching glimpses of the elusive blackfire, Riftwardens instead attempt to close these portals. Because Riftwardens hinder the efforts of Blackfire Adepts, the summoners take whatever opportunities come their way to sabotage or corrupt these hated rivals.</span></p>\n<h2

Blackfire Adept prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A Blackfire Adept gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Sacred Summons</strong>: A Blackfire Adept gains Sacred Summons<sup>UM</sup> as a bonus feat at 1st level, as if she had an evil aura (regardless of her actual alignment).<br /><br /><strong>Blackfire Taint (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, as a standard action, a Blackfire Adept can corrupt the planar substrate into strands of blackfire that create a destructive resonance between herself and a target within 30 feet. She gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls and caster level checks against the target, and the target takes a &ndash;1 penalty on saving throws against the adept&rsquo;s attacks (or &ndash;2 if the attack is a conjuration effect). The taint lasts a number of rounds equal to her class level, though a successful Will save (DC 10 + the Blackfire Adept&rsquo;s class level + the Blackfire Adept&rsquo;s Charisma modifier) reduces this to 1 round. The effect immediately ends if the target moves more than 30 feet away from the Blackfire Adept.<br /><br />The profane bonus and penalty become +2 and &ndash;2 (&ndash;3 against conjuration effects) at 6th level. They become +3 and &ndash;3 (&ndash;4 against conjuration effects) at 10th level.<br /><br /><strong>Blackfire Pact (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Blackfire Adept may choose one evil outsider subtype from among the following: asura, daemon, demodand, demon, devil, div, kyton, oni, qlippoth, or rakshasa. Against outsiders with that subtype, she gains a +1 profane bonus on saving throws, caster level checks, Charisma checks, and Charisma-based skill checks. When using the <em>planar ally </em>or <em>planar binding </em>spells, she can call 2 additional Hit Dice of outsiders with the chosen subtype, and those creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her class level, a +1 profane bonus on saving throws, and a +1 profane bonus to the caster level DC for effects that would banish, dismiss, or dispel them.<br /><br />At 6th level and 9th level, the Blackfire Adept may select an additional evil outsider subtype for her blackfire pact. In addition, the bonus against any one of her selected subtypes (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +1.<br /><br /><strong>Blackfire Eruption (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, a Blackfire Adept can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of 4th level or higher, calling forth a searing ebon vortex in the spell&rsquo;s stead. A blackfire eruption acts as <em>unholy blight</em>, but its maximum damage is increased by 1d8 points (2d6 against good outsiders) per level of the sacrificed spell above 4th. A blackfire eruption ignores the hardness of objects, as it unravels their fundamental reality. A creature slain or an object destroyed by a blackfire eruption is reduced to ash, as by the <em>disintegrate </em>spell. This is a conjuration effect.<br /><br /><strong>Breaching (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, when a Blackfire Adept attempts to call or summon a creature from one of her blackfire pact subtypes into an area where summoning is blocked by a magical effect (such as <em>magic circle against evil</em>, <em>forbiddance</em>, or <em>dimensional lock</em>), or when a creature within 30 feet she has called or summoned from her blackfire pact would have its attacks against a creature blocked by such an effect, as a swift action she can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of the same level as the warding effect. If her caster level is higher than the caster level of the warding effect, it is immediately negated. If it is the same or lower, a caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the warding) is required to negate the warding effect.<br /><br />At 10th level, a Blackfire Adept&rsquo;s breaching can penetrate and destroy an <em>antimagic field</em>, a <em>prismatic sphere</em>, or an extradimensional shelter like a <em>mage&rsquo;s magnificent mansion</em>, though a caster level check is always required regardless of the Blackfire Adept&rsquo;s caster level. She can summon creatures into a naturally magic-dead area (such as the Mana Wastes) with a successful DC 31 caster level check, but the magic-dead area is not negated.<br /><br /><strong>Breaching Legion (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, when a Blackfire Adept summons a creature from one of her blackfire pact subtypes, she can choose to allow that creature to use any innate summoning abilities it possesses. The creatures it summons are not under the Blackfire Adept&rsquo;s control. Once this decision is made, it cannot be reversed until the summoned creature is sent back to whence it came.<br /><br /><strong>Accursed Sympathy (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, whenever a Blackfire Adept or her called or summoned creature deals hit point damage to a target affected by her blackfire taint, as a swift action she can increase the damage dealt by the attack by 1 hit point per class level. If the target dies, the Blackfire Adept gains temporary hit points equal to 1/2 the target&rsquo;s total number of Hit Dice. These temporary hit points last 1 hour and do not stack.<br /><br /><strong>Riftward Breaching (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, whenever one or more creatures appear via a conjuration effect (including calling, summoning, or teleportation effects) within 30 feet of a Blackfire Adept, she can as an immediate action unleash a blackfire eruption that targets all such creatures within 30 feet (but does not affect other creatures). Creatures that fail their saving throws are immediately transported to a random plane in the evil Outer Planes as though affected by a <em>planeshift </em>spell.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.vZkLP0YquQYHOinq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Accursed Sympathy (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_12.jpg","level":8,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.O03KKkG2pbyUaMoq","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blackfire Eruption (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_12.jpg","level":4,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5laSZSUC4OPGpZfC","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blackfire Pact (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_12.jpg","level":3,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.UnxelcS7AFXnD9M9","dataType":"compendium","name":"Blackfire Taint (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_12.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PZYHeO8QVek9ghCl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Breaching (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_12.jpg","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Oj0NTfsljnUvZDnr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Breaching Legion (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_12.jpg","level":7,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.X28JIpCuhLO0Z1qH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Riftward Breaching (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_12.jpg","level":10,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.u41ioYuNHqbt5Y8j","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sacred Summons","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/fire_12.jpg","level":1,"_index":7}]},"tag":"blackfireAdept","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Blackfire Adept","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Invocation (Su)</strong>: A Dawnflower anchorite can harness the sun&rsquo;s life-giving warmth to protect the innocent and smite the wicked. At 1st level, he can invoke the sun as a standard action, granting him a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against evil creatures and adding 1 to the DC of his spells and domain powers (if any) against evil creatures. The bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls increases to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 9th level. If a Dawnflower anchorite has an animal companion, the companion also gains the competence bonus on attack and damage rolls while this ability is active.<br /><br />A Dawnflower anchorite can invoke the sun for a number of rounds per day equal to twice his Dawnflower anchorite class level + his Charisma modifier. Maintaining this ability on subsequent rounds is a free action. These bonuses apply only when the Dawnflower anchorite is standing in an outdoor area of dim light, normal light, or bright light, and only while he is clearly presenting his holy symbol or any scimitar.<br /><br />At 5th level, a Dawnflower anchorite can invoke the sun as a move action instead of a standard action. At 10th level, he can invoke the sun as a swift action.<br /><br /><strong>Credence</strong>: Each Dawnflower anchorite develops a personal credence that guides his worship of Sarenrae. He gains a credence at 2nd level and again every 2 class levels thereafter. Each credence can be chosen only once unless noted otherwise.<br /><br /><em>Dervish Dance</em>: The Dawnflower anchorite gains Dervish Dance<sup>ISWG</sup> as a bonus feat.<br /><br /><em>Divine Light (Su)</em>: The Dawnflower anchorite can use solar invocation indoors or underground, provided he is in an area of dim light, normal light, or bright light. He can use solar invocation 2 additional rounds per day.<br /><br /><em>Extra Invocations (Ex)</em>: The Dawnflower anchorite can use solar invocation for twice as many rounds per day as normal.<br /><br /><em>Focused Class Feature</em>: Choose one of the following class features: animal companion, bane, bardic performance, blessings, channel energy, domain, favored enemy, favored terrain, sacred weapon, or wild shape. The character adds his Dawnflower anchorite class levels to his effective class level in one class of his choice for the purpose of determining the effects of the chosen class feature. This credence can be selected twice, but the Dawnflower anchorite must select a different class feature each time.<br /><br /><em>Shining Servants</em>: The Dawnflower anchorite gains Sunlight Summons<sup>UM</sup> as a bonus feat.<br /><br /><em>Solar Defense (Su)</em>: While using solar invocation, the Dawnflower anchorite adds his competence bonus on attack rolls to his Armor Class as a sacred bonus and to Ref lex saving throws as a dodge bonus. The Dawnflower anchorite can select this credence twice&mdash;the second time he does so, the bonus to Armor Class and on Ref lex saves also applies to any companions who gain bonuses from the Dawnflower anchorite&rsquo;s solar invocation.<br /><br /><em>Solar Weapons (Su)</em>: While using solar invocation, the Dawnflower anchorite can select one weapon (natural or manufactured) wielded by a creature affected by his solar invocation. That weapon gains the <em>flaming</em> weapon special ability for as long as the Dawnflower anchorite&rsquo;s solar invocation persists. A Dawnflower anchorite can select this credence twice&mdash;the second time he does so, the credence grants the <em>flaming burst</em> special ability instead of <em>flaming</em> to the selected weapon. At 5th level, the Dawnflower anchorite can grant two weapons this ability; at 10th level, he can grant up to three weapons this ability.<br /><br /><em>Sun Blade (Su)</em>: Any weapon wielded by the Dawnflower anchorite is treated having the <em>undead-bane</em> special ability against undead who are particularly harmed by sunlight. Ranged weapons impart this ability to any ammunition fired from the weapon. All weapons wielded by the Dawnflower anchorite shed light as per a sunrod, unless the Dawnflower anchorite chooses to suppress this light as a move action (the light activates again automatically the next time the anchorite draws the weapon).<br /><br /><em>Sun&rsquo;s Mercy (Su)</em>: Any creature that gains a competence bonus on attack rolls from the Dawnflower anchorite&rsquo;s solar invocation can deal nonlethal damage with a lethal weapon without taking the usual &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls.<br /><br /><strong>Bask in Radiance (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, when a Dawnflower anchorite uses his solar invocation ability, he can designate any number of allies within 30 feet to gain the bonuses granted by solar invocation for as long as he maintains the ability.<br /><br /><strong>Sunbeam (Sp)</strong>: At 7th level, a Dawnflower anchorite gains the ability to cast <em>sunbeam</em> once per day as a spell-like ability. His caster level is equal to his Hit Dice, and the save DC is Charisma-based. At 10th level, the Dawnflower anchorite can use this ability twice per day.<br /><br /><strong>Dawnflower Invocation (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Dawnflower anchorite is able to, once per day, use his solar invocation ability for 1 minute. The Dawnflower anchorite can also use this ability indoors or underground. While using Dawnflower invocation, all bonuses gained from solar invocation increase by 1. Using this ability doesn&rsquo;t cost rounds per day of solar invocation.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5pOxkF0no21CGJ07","dataType":"compendium","name":"Solar Invocation (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_04.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.HHSN56BJ90E4nsmM","dataType":"compendium","name":"Credence","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_04.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WoU3Zt6QOPw9u7du","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bask in Radiance (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_04.jpg","level":3,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zAxurbQLNDVcNC41","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sunbeam (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_04.jpg","level":7,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.lAOok0cvM7YLsgxJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dawnflower Invocation (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/light_04.jpg","level":10,"_index":4}]},"tag":"dawnflowerAnchorite","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":true,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":true,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":true,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The fascination with operatic performances is well established throughout the nation of Cheliax, yet in Kintargo the lack of direct meddling from the government or the church of Asmodeus (a luxury afforded by the city&rsquo;s relative distance from the Chelish heartland) allowed for performers in Kintargo to lace their works with anti-Thrune metaphors and themes of freedom and individuality that would have swiftly resulted in arrests or even executions had artists dared to perform them elsewhere in the nation.<br /><br />It was from such traditions that Kintargan performers began to build powerful, magical performances, the most famous of which today is the &ldquo;Song of Silver.&rdquo; The potent magic of this song has inspired some Silver Ravens to delve into the secrets and lore of magical performances. These talented performers study not only the history of the songs and plays popular among bards, but also the underlying structures and themes from which these performances derive their magical potential. Using this knowledge, these argent dramaturges subtly alter their bardic performances to make them more effective against the forces of House Thrune and Cheliax.</span></p>\n<h2

class features of the argent dramaturge prestige class.<br /><br /><strong> Argent Performance</strong>: An argent dramaturge can use Perform (sing) to create special magical effects that hinder outsiders (particularly those affected by silver, such as devils) as per the bardic performance bard class feature. She can use this ability for 2 rounds per day for each argent dramaturge level she has, and can use rounds of bardic performance gained from bard levels to perform argent performances and vice-versa. Starting an argent performance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action.<br /><br />An argent performance cannot be disrupted, but ends immediately if the argent dramaturge is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. An argent performance counts as a bardic performance when determining how many performances the argent dramaturge can have in effect at one time. An argent performance has audible components but not visual components. The save DC against an argent dramaturge&rsquo;s performance is equal to 10 + the argent dramaturge&rsquo;s level + her Charisma modifier.<br /><br />At 13th level, an argent dramaturge can start an argent performance as a swift action if she chooses.<br /><br />The performance abilities that an argent dramaturge gains are noted below.<br /><br /><em> Song of Silver (Su)</em> The recovery of the lost lyrics and melody of the famed &ldquo;Song of Silver&rdquo; aided the Silver Ravens immeasurably in their fight against the Chelish tyrant Barzillai Thrune. While the true &ldquo;Song of Silver&rdquo; must be performed in the Kintargo Opera House by a skilled performer, argent dramaturges have learned to create a lesser version of the &ldquo;Song of Silver&rdquo; that can take effect when performed in any location. When the argent dramaturge uses her argent performance to create the &ldquo;Song of Silver,&rdquo; all weapons (both natural and manufactured) within a 30-foot radius of the argent dramaturge are treated as if they were silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, and a number of targets equal to the argent dramaturge&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (minimum 1 target) become immune to fear effects and gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.<br /><br />At 5th level, once per day as an immediate action, an argent dramaturge can grant a single ally who is currently benefiting from the saving throw bonus from the &ldquo;Song of Silver&rdquo; the effects of a <em>breath of life</em> spell (CL = the argent dramaturge&rsquo;s character level). Granting this effect immediately ends the &ldquo;Song of Silver&rdquo; performance, and the argent dramaturge must wait 3 rounds before activating a new &ldquo;Song of Silver&rdquo; (but she can activate other argent or bardic performances in the meantime).<br /><br />At 5th level, the &ldquo;Song of Silver&rdquo; affects a 60-foot-radius area around the argent dramaturge.<br /><br /><em> Anchoring Aria (Su)</em>: At 3rd level, the argent dramaturge can use her knowledge of the magical melodies woven into the Song of Silver to block the dimensional travel of fiends. As long as she maintains the aria, any evil outsider that attempts to use spells or spell-like abilities of the teleportation subschool within a 30-foot radius of the argent dramaturge must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 11 + her character level) or else the spell or spell-like ability fails. An evil outsider that uses a teleportation effect to appear within this 30-foot-radius area or that is summoned into this area must succeed at a Will saving throw or it is staggered for 1 round. At 5th level, this argent performance affects a 60-foot-radius area around the argent dramaturge.<br /><br /><em> Righteous Chord (Sp)</em>: At 9th level, as a standard action that costs 2 rounds of argent or bardic performance, the argent dramaturge can affect a single evil outsider within 60 feet as per the spell <em>banishment</em>, treating her character level as her caster level. As a free action, the argent dramaturge can attempt a Perform check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the targeted outsider. If successful, she is treated as having presented the targeted outsider with one object or substance the target fears or hates for the purpose of determining the effects of the banishment spell. Activating this argent performance does not end a currently active argent or bardic performance.<br /><br /><strong> Dramaturgical Flourish (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an argent dramaturge&rsquo;s studies into the history and structure of stories grant her access to secret performances, allowing her to select an option from the list of dramaturgical flourishes below. Unless otherwise noted, an argent dramaturge cannot select a dramaturgical flourish more than once.<br /><br /><em> Heartening Song</em>: An argent dramaturge&rsquo;s countersong functions against mind-affecting effects that rely on negative emotions (such as crushing despair, rage, or fear effects) as well as sonic and language-dependent effects. An argent dramaturge must have the countersong bardic performance to select this dramaturgical flourish.<br /><br /><em> Masterpiece</em>: The argent dramaturge gains a bardic masterpiece (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic</em> 21) without needing to sacrifice a feat or spell known. She must still meet the prerequisites of the masterpiece. An argent dramaturge can take this flourish more than once, but must select a new bardic masterpiece each time she does so.<br /><br /><em> Reactive Performance</em>: The argent dramaturge can activate her countersong or distraction bardic performance as an immediate action. When she does so, she must expend 2 rounds of bardic performance rather than 1. An argent dramaturge must have the countersong and distraction bardic performances to select this dramaturgical flourish.<br /><br /><em>Sudden Competence</em>: An argent dramaturge can activate her inspire competence bardic performance as an immediate action by spending 2 rounds of bardic performance. She can even use this ability after an ally has failed a skill check. If the check would have been successful with the inspire competence bonus, the character attempting the check instead succeeds at that check. An argent dramaturge must have the inspire competence bardic performance to select this dramaturgical flourish.<br /><br /><em> Ultimate Courage</em>: Allies who are affected by the argent dramaturge&rsquo;s inspire courage bardic performance gain double the normal morale bonuses on saving throws against fear and charm effects. An argent dramaturge must have the inspire courage bardic performance to select this dramaturgical flourish.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.G7k0vZpAYPyVPmMk","dataType":"compendium","name":"Argent Performance","img":"icons/tools/instruments/harp-lap-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.CmuflwINZzxCQr93","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dramaturgical Flourish (Su)","img":"icons/tools/instruments/harp-lap-brown.webp","level":2,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.B1a8xXoo2CkuI2oF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Performance: Song of Silver (Su)","img":"icons/tools/instruments/harp-lap-brown.webp","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pSXu8KXcsFnoxoHe","dataType":"compendium","name":"Performance: Righteous Chord (Sp)","img":"icons/tools/instruments/harp-lap-brown.webp","level":9,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.hugdQhSUf5T8MgZm","dataType":"compendium","name":"Performance: Anchoring Aria (Su)","img":"icons/tools/instruments/harp-lap-brown.webp","level":3,"_index":4}]},"tag":"argentDramaturge","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":6,"hp":6,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":true,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Argent Dramaturge","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

and Armor Proficiency</strong>: An envoy of balance gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: When an envoy of balance gains a level, she gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character has more than one spellcasting class, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.<br /><br /><strong>Incisive Spells (Su)</strong>: An envoy of balance gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the spell resistance of creatures with an alignment subtype. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level.<br /><br /><strong>Endowment (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level and again at 4th, 6th, and 8th level, an envoy of balance gains one of the following endowments.<br /><br /><em>Aligned Annulment</em>: As a standard action, the envoy of balance can expend a spell with an alignment descriptor to automatically (without requiring a caster level check) dispel a spell with the opposite descriptor. The spell she expends must be of the same level or higher than the spell being dispelled. An envoy of balance must have the aligned counter endowment to choose this endowment.<br /><br /><em>Aligned Counter</em>: The envoy of balance can counterspell a spell with an alignment descriptor using a spell with the opposite alignment descriptor. The spell used to counterspell must be higher level than the spell being countered, unless the envoy of balance has the Improved Counterspell feat, in which case it can be the same level or higher. An envoy of balance with the Improved Counterspell feat can use the aligned counter ability as an immediate action instead of a readied action, but must expend an appropriate spell at least 2 levels higher than the spell to be countered.<br /><br /><em>Planar Parity</em>: <em>Protection from chaos/evil/good/law </em>and similar effects no longer prevent bodily contact from creatures summoned by the envoy of balance. Neutral creatures summoned by the envoy of balance also gain the counterpoised simple creature template (see the inside back cover).<br /><br /><em>Spiritual Equilibrium</em>: The envoy of balance&rsquo;s class levels count as cleric levels for determining the effects of her channel energy ability. If she has the spontaneous casting class feature, she is no longer restricted by the choice made at 1st level to convert prepared spells into cure or inf lict spells. Each time the envoy of balance converts a spell, she can choose to convert it into a cure spell or an inf lict spell. Additionally, when using the Versatile Channeler feat, her effective cleric level is no longer reduced by 2&mdash;instead, she uses her full effective cleric level. An envoy of balance must have the Versatile Channeler feat to choose this endowment.<br /><br /><em>Twinned Channeling</em>: When channeling energy, the envoy of balance can simultaneously release waves of positive and negative energy. She chooses a category of creatures (either living or undead), and this conjoined energy both heals and harms the affected creatures. Roll the amounts of damage healed and dealt separately. Treat the envoy of balance&rsquo;s effective cleric level as 2 lower than normal for the amounts of damage and the DC to halve damage taken. The envoy of balance can choose whether to include herself in either or both the healing and harming effects. If she has an ability that allows her to exclude targets from her channeled energy, such as the Selective Channel feat, she can choose to exclude different targets from the healing effect than from the harming effect. An envoy of balance must possess the spiritual equilibrium endowment to choose this endowment.<br /><br /><em>Utterly Inscrutable</em>: The envoy of balance gains the benefits of a <em>mind blank </em>spell whose caster level is equal to her character level. She can suppress this ability as a swift action and resume it as an immediate action. An envoy of balance must be 8th level to choose this endowment.<br /><br /><strong>Contravening Armament (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, an envoy of balance&rsquo;s natural and manufactured weapons bypass alignment-based damage reduction. As a standard action, she can touch an ally to transfer this ability to him for 1 minute, during which time the envoy of balance can&rsquo;t benefit from the ability. The envoy of balance can transfer this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.<br /><br /><strong>Ethical Paradox (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, an envoy of balance remains unaffected by effects from spells and magical abilities based on her alignment or faith. She doesn&rsquo;t trigger glyphs, symbols, magical traps, or magical sensors set to activate based on a creature&rsquo;s alignment or religion. She counts as the most favorable alignment or faith for the purposes of any harmful effects these alignment- or faithbased spells or abilities may have, but doesn&rsquo;t gain benefits these effects might grant those of a particular alignment or faith unless she is actually of that alignment or faith.<br /><br /><strong>Retributive Symmetry (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, once per day as an immediate action, an envoy of balance can cause a spell targeting her to affect both herself and the spell&rsquo;s caster at full effect, as if both creatures had <em>spell turning </em>cast on them and then rolled the appropriate result on that spell&rsquo;s table.<br /><br /><strong>Scales of Mortality (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, once per day as a standard action, an envoy of balance can make a melee touch attack, delivering a killing touch against a living creature. If the attack hits and the target is not neutral, the target is subject to a <em>power word kill </em>spell. If the attack misses or the target is neutral, this ability is wasted. If the target dies, its bodily remains (but not its equipment) turn to dust, as <em>disintegrate</em>. If this ability kills the target, the envoy of balance becomes aware of that creature&rsquo;s alignment and may then touch the remains of another dead creature with fewer Hit Dice than or Hit Dice equal to the slain creature&rsquo;s and with an alignment opposite to the slain creature&rsquo;s on the good-evil axis, the lawful-chaotic axis, or both. This revives the second dead creature as if via true resurrection.

Even the gods themselves must face death, as evidenced by the death of the god Aroden a century ago. Creatures that attempt to avoid death through any means mock the order all living things must submit to, and as such mock the sacred act of assassination. Undead are particularly upsetting to some members of the Red Mantis, and death slayers are trained as specialized agents for missions where the target of an assassination is undead, or when an assassinated target returns from death as one of the undead.<br /><br />Just as Red Mantis assassins do not wantonly slaughter the living, death slayers don&rsquo;t indiscriminately seek out undead to destroy. They focus instead on eliminating specific targets they&rsquo;ve been hired to destroy, and they take special satisfaction in destroying those who were assassinated in life by one of their colleagues. A death slayer may even take a contract from one undead client to destroy another, such as two vampires squabbling over territory that holds increasingly sparse human chattel. Death slayers also have a situational exception regarding the prohibition on targeting monarchs. Should a rightful monarch become an undead creature of any sort&mdash; whether intentionally (to extend his reign), via a curse, or by other means&mdash;this negates the monarch&rsquo;s previous divine mandate, and the death slayer is not restrained by the Red Mantis&rsquo;s taboo against killing rightful monarchs for this particular target. Of course, a monarch who becomes undead does not earn the enmity of the Red Mantis simply through the act of becoming undead: an outside agent must still hire the Red Mantis to take out the monarch.<br /><br />While the majority of death slayers worship Achaekek, worshipers of any deity can follow the teachings of the death slayer, provided those who take levels in the prestige class are themselves at least affiliated with the Red Mantis. Good or chaotic death slayers, while incredibly rare, are not impossibilities. Likewise, while most death slayers were once clerics, any divine spellcaster could, in theory, study to become a death slayer.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to

of the death slayer prestige class.<br /><br /><strong> Channel Energy (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a death slayer gains the power to harm undead with positive energy. This ability functions as a cleric&rsquo;s ability to channel positive energy to deal damage to undead (but not to heal living creatures), and it counts as channel energy for the purposes of qualifying for feats or determining effects that rely on channel energy. A death slayer uses her class level as her effective cleric level when channeling energy. She can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and an additional 1d6 points of damage every 2 levels thereafter. Death slayer levels stack with levels in any class that grants channel energy (if any) for the purpose of determining the number of damage dice her channel energy ability deals to undead, but this channel energy can never do anything other than harm undead. An undead creature that takes damage from this channeled energy can attempt a Will save to halve the damage; the DC of this save is equal to 10 + the death slayer&rsquo;s class level + her Charisma modifier. The death slayer must be able to present either her holy symbol or a sawtooth sabre to use this ability.<br /><br /><strong> Channel Smite</strong>: A death slayer gains Channel Smite as a bonus feat. If she already has this feat, she instead gains a different feat selected from those bonus feats normally available to her at 2nd level (see below).<br /><br /><strong> Gravegaze (Su)</strong>: A death slayer gains the benefits of <em>deathwatch</em> at all times.<br /><br /><strong> Bonus Feats</strong>: At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a death slayer gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from the following: Extra Channel, Greater Channel Smite<sup>UC</sup>, Guided Hand<sup>UC</sup>, Improved Channel, Life Lure<sup>UM</sup>, Quick Channel<sup>UM</sup>, Shatter Control<sup>HA</sup>, Thanatopic Spell<sup>UM</sup>, Threnodic Spell<sup>UM</sup>, or Turn Undead. The death slayer must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.<br /><br /><strong> Favored Enemy (Ex</strong>:) At 2nd level, a death slayer gains undead as a favored enemy. This ability functions as the ranger class feature of the same name and stacks with similar bonuses from other classes. (This doesn&rsquo;t increase existing favored enemy bonuses against any other creature types.) At 6th level, the death slayer&rsquo;s favored enemy bonus against undead increases to +4.<br /><br /><strong> Swift Smite (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a death slayer can use her Channel Smite feat an additional number of times per day equal to her death slayer level without expending a use of her total channel energy uses per day. She cannot use these additional uses of Channel Smite to use channel energy in the regular way. Whenever she uses Channel Smite, she can activate the ability as an immediate action after she rolls for a melee attack but before the result is revealed.<br /><br /><strong> Infuse Sabre (Su)</strong>: Once per day at 4th level, a death slayer can infuse a wielded sawtooth sabre with positive energy as a swift action. This infusion of energy lasts for 3 rounds. When brandishing an infused sabre, a death slayer&rsquo;s channeled energy damage increases by half (+50%), and undead take a &ndash;2 penalty on all saving throws against her channeled energy and against any spell she casts. At 7th level, she can infuse a sabre twice per day, and at 10th level she can do so three times a day, but she can have only one infused sabre at a time.<br /><br /><strong> Deadly Conviction (Su)</strong>: At 6th level, a death slayer gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against spells and effects created by undead creatures. Once per day, she can ignore 1 negative level that would otherwise affect her.<br /><br /><strong> Undead Bane</strong>: At 8th level, one sawtooth sabre a death slayer wields functions as a <em>bane</em> weapon against undead creatures as long as the death slayer wields the weapon.<br /><br /><strong> Aura of Life (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a death slayer can emit a 10-foot aura of positive energy that weakens undead creatures as a swift action. This creates a dim crimson glow around the death slayer. Each undead creature within the aura at the start of its turn takes 4d6 points of positive energy damage. While this aura is active, the death slayer has fast healing 10. A death slayer can activate this aura for up to 10 rounds per day. The duration need not be consecutive, and she can deactivate the aura as a free action.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aiz8xce057bEouIw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Channel Energy (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.MLjnKbRqFvymlsuY","dataType":"compendium","name":"Channel Smite","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.93FAXnCjXZ1Sp4bW","dataType":"compendium","name":"Gravegaze (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.E7iIonyZXjKlkYHK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Bonus Feats","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.K1BwIjNjPE7X60qs","dataType":"compendium","name":"Favored Enemy (Ex) ","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.BNtzOcyIRKfvrlaH","dataType":"compendium","name":"Swift Smite (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":3,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.U8McFsCK1SqRNMEd","dataType":"compendium","name":"Infuse Sabre (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":4,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KvTvQsGXYoa7nbmZ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deadly Conviction (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":6,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.YqplO5rKcCoPAgko","dataType":"compendium","name":"Undead Bane","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":8,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.w9bginOkgU0pLO5A","dataType":"compendium","name":"Aura of Life (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/green_03.jpg","level":10,"_index":9}]},"tag":"deathSlayer","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":true,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":true,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":true,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":true},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Arcane archers are masters of ranged combat, as they possess the ability to strike at targets with unerring accuracy and can imbue their arrows with powerful spells. Arrows fired by arcane archers fly at weird and uncanny angles to strike at foes around corners, and can pass through solid objects to hit enemies that cower behind such cover. At the height of their power, arcane archers can fell even the most powerful foes with a single, deadly shot. <br /><br />Those who have trained as both rangers and wizards excel as arcane archers, although other multiclass combinations are not unheard of. Arcane archers may be found wherever elves travel, but not all are allies of the elves. Many, particularly half-elven arcane archers, use elven traditions solely for their own gain, or worse, against the elves whose very traditions they adhere to. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Arcane archers deal death from afar, winnowing down opponents while their allies rush into hand-to-hand combat. With their capacity to unleash hails of arrows on the enemy, they represent the pinnacle of ranged combat. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Arcane archers can be of any alignment. Elf or half-elf arcane arches tend to be free-spirited and are rarely lawful. Similarly, it is uncommon for elven arcane archers to be evil, and overall the path of the arcane archer is more often pursued by good or neutral characters.</span></p>\n<h2

arcane archer prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: An arcane archer is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields. <br /><br /><strong>Spells per Day</strong>: At the indicated levels, an arcane archer gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an arcane archer, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day. <br /><br /><strong>Enhance Arrows (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for him. <br /><br />In addition, the arcane archer's arrows gain a number of additional qualities as he gains additional levels. The elemental, elemental burst, and aligned qualities can be changed once per day, when the arcane archer prepares spells or, in the case of spontaneous spellcasters, after 8 hours of rest. <br /><br />At 3rd level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains one of the following elemental themed weapon qualities: <em>flaming</em>, <em>frost</em>, or <em>shock</em>. <br /><br />At 5th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains the <em>distance </em>weapon quality. <br /><br />At 7th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains one of the following elemental burst weapon qualities: <em>flaming burst</em>, <em>icy burst</em>, or <em>shocking burst</em>. This ability replaces the ability gained at 3rd level. <br /><br />At 9th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains one of the following aligned weapon qualities: <em>anarchic</em>, <em>axiomatic</em>, <em>holy</em>, or <em>unholy</em>. The arcane archer cannot choose an ability that is the opposite of his alignment (for example, a lawful good arcane archer could not choose <em>anarchic </em>or <em>unholy </em>as his weapon quality). <br /><br />The bonuses granted by a magic bow apply as normal to arrows that have been enhanced with this ability. Only the larger enhancement bonus applies. Duplicate abilities do not stack. <br /><br /><strong>Imbue Arrow (Sp)</strong>: At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell's area is centered where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. A spell cast in this way uses its standard casting time and the arcane archer can fire the arrow as part of the casting. The arrow must be fired during the round that the casting is completed or the spell is wasted. If the arrow misses, the spell is wasted. <br /><br /><strong>Seeker Arrow (Sp)</strong>: At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow at a target known to him within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). An arcane archer can use this ability once per day at 4th level, and one additional time per day for every two levels beyond 4th, to a maximum of four times per day at 10th level. <br /><br /><strong>Phase Arrow (Sp)</strong>: At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to him within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, armor, and shield modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). An arcane archer can use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one additional time per day for every two levels beyond 6th, to a maximum of three times per day at 10th level. <br /><br /><strong>Hail of Arrows (Sp)</strong>: In lieu of his regular attacks, once per day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow. <br /><br /><strong>Arrow of Death (Sp)</strong>: At 10th level, an arcane archer can create a special type of <em>slaying arrow </em>that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a Fortitude save or be slain immediately. The DC of this save is equal to 20 + the arcane archer's Charisma modifier. It takes 1 day to make a <em>slaying arrow</em>, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The <em>slaying arrow </em>lasts no longer than 1 year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.873sM1TTcevPBm24","dataType":"compendium","name":"Arrow of Death (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_05.jpg","level":10,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.gEqzRu6WsZdVlFeK","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hail of Arrows (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_05.jpg","level":8,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.8N5To17Cqhl4052m","dataType":"compendium","name":"Phase Arrow (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_05.jpg","level":6,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zsX2th2lu3gLIt7P","dataType":"compendium","name":"Seeker Arrow (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_05.jpg","level":4,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.u3FaR5SwGd1JNy07","dataType":"compendium","name":"Imbue Arrow (Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_05.jpg","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.5cIlmiCAF4jXnj21","dataType":"compendium","name":"Enhance Arrows (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/weapon_05.jpg","level":1,"_index":5}]},"tag":"arcaneArcher","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":true,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":true,"sur":true,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Arcane Archer","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

The company&rsquo;s origin lies with a band of Gray Maidens led by Qualins Rachmirol, who commandeered a ship in the wake of Ileosa&rsquo;s defeat and sailed to Cheliax. Her Infernal Majestrix was impressed by the soldiers&rsquo; devotion and prowess; Abrogail adopted them into the Chelish military and gave the group its new name.<br /><br />The Erinyes Company has expanded from its original 27 members, although not drastically, as the initiation process for new recruits is intense and often lethal. By the end, the survivors are every bit as physically and psychologically scarred as the original Gray Maidens. The company has, however, abandoned Ileosa&rsquo;s doctrine of racial purity; drive and will are what make an Erinyes, not skin or shape.<br /><br />Elite Erinyes Company members are heartless soldiers known as sanguine angels. While the Gray Maidens were once a secular organization, the majority of the Erinyes have turned to worship the infernal demigoddesses known as the Queens of the Night. These vengeful devils reward the company&rsquo;s elite with infernal powers.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a sanguine angel, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong> Alignment</strong>: Lawful evil, lawful neutral, or neutral evil. <br /><strong>Armor Proficiency</strong>: Proficient with heavy armor. <br /><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong>: +5. <br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Improved Shield Bash, Iron Will, Weapon Focus (longsword).<br /><strong> Gender</strong>: Female.<br /><strong> Language</strong>: Infernal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Sanguine Angel's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perception (Wis), and Sense Motive (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Hardened heart, maiden&rsquo;s shield</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Tyrant&rsquo;s discipline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Armored angel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Tyrant&rsquo;s discipline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Eye of Mahathallah</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Tyrant&rsquo;s discipline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Mystique of Ardad Lili</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Tyrant&rsquo;s discipline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Hollowness of Doloras</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.06833%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.0508%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.1732%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.0559%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.987%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.2924%;\">Angel of Eiseth, tyrant&rsquo;s discipline</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the sanguine angel prestige class.<br /><br /><strong> Hardened Heart (Ex)</strong> A sanguine angel adds twice her class level to the DC of any attempt to Intimidate her.<br /><br /><strong> Maiden&rsquo;s Shield (Ex)</strong> A sanguine angel is treated as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat as long as she is using a longsword and a shield. This allows her to take feats that require Two-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite without meeting the Two-Weapon Fighting or Dexterity prerequisites, but she benefits from such feats only when she&rsquo;s wielding a longsword and shield.<br /><br /><strong> Tyrant&rsquo;s Discipline (Ex)</strong> The Erinyes Company&rsquo;s initiation is deeply indoctrinating, and so sanguine angels are as loyal to the Infernal Majestrix as the Gray Maidens were to Ileosa. At 2nd level, a sanguine angel draws upon her indoctrination, tactical training, and devotion to tyranny to develop potent talents. A sanguine angel selects a discipline from the following list at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter.<br /><br /><em> Castling</em>: When the sanguine angel takes a 5-foot step, she can step into the space of a willing, adjacent ally. If she does, that ally immediately takes a 5-foot step into the sanguine angel&rsquo;s former space without spending an action to do so.<br /><br /><em> Driving Assault</em>: When making a full attack, the sanguine angel can take a &ndash;2 penalty on melee attack rolls for 1 round. If she does, the first time in that round that she hits a creature of her size or smaller with a melee attack, she can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check to push the creature back 5 feet. She gains a +2 bonus on this combat maneuver check and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when performing the bull rush, but regardless of the result, she cannot push the target further than 5 feet. If the sanguine angel pushes a creature in this way, she can immediately move into its space without provoking attacks of opportunity.<br /><br /><em> Erinyes Fury</em>: The sanguine angel can enter a dispassionate, murderous state. This functions as the dreadnought barbarian&rsquo;s dead calm ability (<em>Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures</em> 47) and is usable for a number of rounds each day equal to twice her class level. If the sanguine angel has levels in barbarian and has the dreadnought archetype, her sanguine angel levels instead stack with her barbarian levels to determine the duration of her rage.<br /><br /><em> Furious Huntress</em>: The sanguine angel adds her Strength bonus, rather than her Dexterity bonus, to attack rolls made with bows.<br /><br /><em> Kinslayer</em>: The sanguine angel gains favored enemy (humanoids [humans] +2), as per the ranger ability. If the sanguine angel already has the same favored enemy bonus from another class, her existing bonus instead increases by 2.<br /><br /><em> Merciless Massacre</em>: When the sanguine angel hits a cowering or panicked creature with a melee attack or reduces a creature to negative hit points with a melee attack, as a swift action she can deal additional damage to that creature equal to 1d8 + her class level.<br /><br /><em> Queen&rsquo;s Sword</em>: The sanguine angel&rsquo;s weapon training bonus with heavy blades increases by 1. The sanguine angel must have at least 4 levels in this prestige class and have the weapon training (heavy blades) class feature to select this discipline. The sanguine angel can select this discipline a second time when her class level is 8th level or higher.<br /><br /><em> Unyielding</em>: While wearing Gray Maiden plate (see page 84), the sanguine angel gains DR 1/&mdash;. The character must have at least 6 levels in this prestige class to select this discipline. The damage reduction increases to DR/2 at 8th level and to DR/3 at 10th level. This damage reduction does not stack with damage reduction granted by other sources.<br /><br /><strong> Armored Angel (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a sanguine angel gains the armor training class feature, treating her class level as her fighter level while wearing Gray Maiden plate. If the sanguine angel has levels in another class that grants the armor training class feature, the levels stack to determine its benefits, but only when she is wearing Gray Maiden plate.<br /><br /><strong> Eye of Mahathallah (Su)</strong>: The Dowager of Illusion, the first Queen of the Night to grant her favor to the Erinyes Company, grants sanguine angels keen eyes to pierce all deception. At 5th level, a sanguine angel gains Alertness as a bonus feat and gains a +4 profane bonus on Will saves against illusions. In addition, once per day as a swift action, the sanguine angel can take 1d4 points of Charisma damage to gain the benefits of the <em>true seeing</em> spell for a number of rounds equal to her class level.<br /><br /><strong> Mystique of Ardad Lili (Ex and Sp)</strong>: Though most sanguine angels care little for seduction, the End of Innocence grants them influence over others regardless. At 7th level, a sanguine angel gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against targets of the same creature type as the sanguine angel. Once per day, the sanguine angel can use <em>dominate person</em> as a spell-like ability (CL = her character level).<br /><br /><strong> Hollowness of Doloras (Ex)</strong>: The gift of Our Lady of Pain is freedom&mdash;freedom from horror and pain, from sorrow and fear. At 9th level, a sanguine angel gains Diehard as a bonus feat. In addition, she gains a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against emotion<sup>UM</sup> and pain<sup>UM</sup> effects, and she is immune to fear effects.<br /><br /><strong> Angel of Eiseth (Su)</strong>: The greatest sanguine angels earn the favor of the Erinyes Queen Eiseth, who transforms them into infernal servitors. At 10th level, a sanguine angel&rsquo;s type changes to outsider (evil, extraplanar, lawful), and Hell becomes her native plane. She gains fire resistance 30, telepathy with a range of 50 feet, and the see in darkness universal monster ability. Ebon-feathered wings emerge from the sanguine angel&rsquo;s back, granting her a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.0F3fra3luKV49r78","dataType":"compendium","name":"Angel of Eiseth (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_32.jpg","level":10,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.T4eABxEuYdVveYPj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Armored Angel (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_32.jpg","level":3,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.aBsPllbUior5PkQU","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eye of Mahathallah (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_32.jpg","level":5,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.WsVJ1QCXpn07RZci","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hardened Heart (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_32.jpg","level":1,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.icOZBqxePnsJbi0M","dataType":"compendium","name":"Hollowness of Doloras (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_32.jpg","level":9,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Xg5DHk2DkMianntl","dataType":"compendium","name":"Maiden's Shield (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_32.jpg","level":1,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.2PyGmB1R6ciYAaBb","dataType":"compendium","name":"Mystique of Ardad Lili (Ex and Sp)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_32.jpg","level":7,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.D2XKqo13tiVc2vPF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tyrant's Discipline (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_32.jpg","level":2,"_index":7}]},"tag":"sanguineAngel","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

Inner Sea pirates often captain their own ships; those who do not usually serve as officers or aboard notorious ships under accomplished captains.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Inner Sea pirates are often chaotic and rarely good, but can be any nonlawful alignment.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an Inner Sea pirate, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any nonlawful.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Appraise 5 ranks, Profession (sailor) 5 ranks, Swim 5 ranks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Inner Sea Pirate's class skills are Appraise (Int), Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Profession (sailor) (Wis), and Swim (Str).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 6 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Sneak attack +1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Pirate trick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Pirate trick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Sneak attack +2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Pirate trick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Advanced tricks, pirate trick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Sneak attack +3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Pirate trick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Pirate trick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.78692%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.1945%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.9181%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 11.7318%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.1955%;\">Sneak attack +4d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Inner Sea pirate prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: An Inner Sea pirate gains proficiency with the cutlass, hook hand, rapier, and short sword. An Inner Sea pirate gains no armor proficiency.<br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at 4th level and every three levels thereafter. If an Inner Sea pirate gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the damage bonuses stack.<br /><br /><strong>Pirate Talent</strong>: As an Inner Sea pirate develops her skill, she learns a number of tricks that aid her in her work. She gains a pirate trick at 4th level and every three levels thereafter. An Inner Sea pirate cannot select an individual trick more than once.<br /><br />Tricks marked with an asterisk add effects to an Inner Sea pirate&rsquo;s sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.<br /><br /><em>Classic Duelist (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls made with a cutlass, rapier, or short sword.<br /><br /><em>Deep Breath (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to three times her Constitution modifier before she must start making Constitution checks.<br /><br /><em>Drink for Free (Ex)</em>: This ability presumes that the Inner Sea pirate is admired or feared in the taverns she frequents. The Inner Sea pirate designates one tavern per Inner Sea pirate level as a &ldquo;favored tavern.&rdquo; When in a favored tavern, the Inner Sea pirate drinks for free. In addition, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks within a favored tavern.<br /><br /><em>Farseer (Ex)</em>: Pirates take turns serving as lookouts. An Inner Sea pirate with this ability reduces any distancebased penalties on Perception checks by half when she is at least 10 feet off the ground or above the deck of a ship.<br /><br /><em>Hand Stab* (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate can weaken an opponent&rsquo;s weapon hand by hitting with a sneak attack. When she deals sneak attack damage against an opponent, that opponent becomes easier to disarm. Until the end of the rogue&rsquo;s next turn, anyone attempting to disarm that opponent gains a +2 bonus on the disarm attempt.<br /><br /><em>Quick Appraise (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate must at times quickly select the most valuable items to spirit away. She appraises an item as a move action and can determine the most valuable item in a treasure hoard as a standard action.<br /><br /><em>Rigging Monkey (Ex)</em>: Some pirates become skilled at climbing on ropes and rigging. This ability grants the Inner Sea pirate a +2 bonus on Climb checks when using a rope to help her climb. In addition, when using a rope to help her climb, the Inner Sea pirate can move at half her speed. (By accepting a &ndash;5 penalty she can move at her normal speed.)<br /><br /><em>Storm Sailor (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate treats all storms as if they were one category less severe for the purposes of sailing and navigation. (This benefit stacks with the Hurricane Savvy character trait and other effects related to wind conditions.) She can make an Acrobatics check to move her normal speed across uneven ground, and she does not take a penalty on any Acrobatics checks due to slightly slippery, slightly unsteady, or moderately unsteady conditions.<br /><br /><em>Windrigger (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate has learned the tricky art of tacking. With a DC 15 Profession (sailor) check, she increases her ship&rsquo;s base movement by 5 feet for 1 hour.<br /><br /><strong>Advanced Tricks</strong>: At 6th, 8th, and 9th level, an Inner Sea pirate can choose one of the following advanced tricks in place of a pirate trick.<br /><br /><em>Burst of Speed (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate has learned to coax speed out of her ship when it really counts. With a DC 20 Profession (sailor) check, she doubles her ship&rsquo;s base movement for 1 round. She can use this ability once per day.<br /><br /><em>Defensive Climber (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC when climbing.<br /><br /><em>Fearsome Advance* (Ex)</em>: If the Inner Sea pirate deals damage with her sneak attack, she can make an Intimidate check as an immediate action to demoralize the damaged opponent.<br /><br /><em>Foot Sweep* (Ex)</em>: The Inner Sea pirate has learned to sweep her opponents&rsquo; legs when they are reeling from the pain of her precise attacks. If the Inner Sea pirate deals damage with a sneak attack, she can make a trip attack against the damaged opponent as an immediate action. All the usual rules for trip attacks apply, and feats such as Improved Trip modify the attack normally.<br /><br /><em>Shipboard Authority (Ex)</em>: As a full-round action once per day, the Inner Sea pirate can shout orders to her crew. All allies within 30 feet of the Inner Sea pirate who can hear her gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls or on a particular skill check for 1 round per the Inner Sea pirate&rsquo;s level. The Inner Sea pirate specifies which bonus applies when she uses this ability and may not change the bonus for the duration of this ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.O93n7H9kMd1xC58Q","dataType":"compendium","name":"Advanced Tricks","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-pirate-black.webp","level":2,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.bVJlqJpzLFfnA61b","dataType":"compendium","name":"Sneak Attack (Ex)","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-pirate-black.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.HRbY7bS8JXAi1w9b","dataType":"compendium","name":"Pirate Talent","img":"icons/equipment/head/hat-tricorn-pirate-black.webp","level":6,"_index":2}]},"tag":"innerSeaPirate","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":"cutlass, hook hand, rapier, and short sword"},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":6,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":true,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":true,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":true,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":true,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

A master spy is an expert at both magical and nonmagical means of evading detection, and quick-witted when it comes to improvisation. Master spies may serve countries or private interests, or sell their services to the highest bidder without a thought to long-term loyalty. <br /><br />Bards and rogues, with their wide range of skills, are particularly well suited for the demands of spying. Rogues can easily pass themselves off as members of most nonmagical professions (though playing an armored warrior impedes their natural abilities), while bluffing bards can impersonate a wide range of other spellcasters well enough to fool a casual observer. Versatility and adaptability are the watchwords for espionage, and successful master spies let others complete their deception for them, subtly drawing targets into their machinations. <br /><br /><strong>Role</strong>: Master spies rarely work with others unless they are under cover. The special skills that serve them so well in the field ironically make them exceptional leaders, but a master spy's natural inclination toward secrecy pushes her away from the limelight. Note that a master spy among adventurers may not intend to betray them; armed heroes provide excellent cover for a master spy's true mission, whether or not they know the spy's intent. <br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: The practice of espionage demands discipline and a certain amount of moral and ethical flexibility; more master spies are neutral than lawful or chaotic.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a master spy, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. <br /><br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Deceitful, Iron Will. <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Bluff 7 ranks, Disguise 7 ranks, Perception 5 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Master Spy's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Dex), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Knowledge (all) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Stealth (Dex), and Use Magic Device (Cha).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 6 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Art of deception, master of disguise, sneak attack +1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Glib lie, mask alignment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Nonmagical aura 2/day, superficial knowledge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Concealed thoughts, quick change, sneak attack +2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Elude detection, slippery mind</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Shift alignment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Sneak attack +3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Death attack, fool casting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Hidden mind</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.84365%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.6201%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.93855%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.00745%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.4655%;\">Assumption, sneak attack +4d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the master spy prestige class. <br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: A master spy gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor. <br /><br /><strong>Art of Deception (Ex)</strong>: A master spy adds her class level to all Bluff, Disguise, and Sense Motive checks. <br /><br /><strong>Master of Disguise (Ex)</strong>: A master spy can create a disguise in half the time normally required. In addition, any penalties from assuming a disguise of a different gender, race, age, or size are reduced by 1. <br /><br /><strong>Sneak Attack (Ex)</strong>: This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at every third level (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th). If a master spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. <br /><br /><strong>Glib Lie (Su)</strong>: A master spy of 2nd level or higher can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the spy must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the master spy's class level to succeed (as if she were under the effect of a <em>glibness </em>spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the spy's lies or force her to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the master spy the <em>glibness </em>spell's bonus on Bluff checks. <br /><br /><strong>Mask Alignment (Su)</strong>: A master spy of 2nd level or higher can alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as <em>detect evil</em>). She may choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. Masking her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect. <br /><br /><strong>Nonmagical Aura (Sp)</strong>: At 3rd level, a master spy can use <em>magic aura </em>twice per day, but only for the purpose of making an object appear nonmagical. <br /><br /><strong>Superficial Knowledge (Ex)</strong>: A master spy gives the appearance of knowing more than she actually does. Starting at 3rd level, she can make untrained Knowledge and Profession checks pertaining to her cover or assumed identity as if she were trained and gains a bonus equal to half her level on these checks. For example, a master spy masquerading as a noblewoman can make untrained Knowledge (history) checks about the kingdom and Knowledge (nobility) checks about its noble and royal families as if she were trained, but she cannot make untrained Knowledge (nature) skill checks to identify herbs. <br /><br /><strong>Concealed Thoughts (Su)</strong>: A 4th-level master spy can conceal her schemes from mind-reading magic. When a creature is using <em>detect thoughts </em>or similar magic to read her mind, she decides what surface thoughts her opponent detects, and her true surface thoughts remain private. This ability does not protect against mental attacks or mind-reading that delves deeper than surface thoughts. <br /><br /><strong>Quick Change (Ex)</strong>: Starting at 4th level, a master spy can assume a disguise in only 2d4 rounds by taking a &ndash;10 penalty on her Disguise check. This penalty drops to &ndash;5 at 8th level. <br /><br /><strong>Elude Detection (Sp)</strong>: At 5th level, a master spy can befuddle divinations used against her as if she were under the effect of a <em>nondetection </em>spell with a caster level equal to her character level. She can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the <em>nondetection </em>for 1d4 rounds. <br /><br /><strong>Slippery Mind (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, a master spy can slip away from mental control. This functions as the rogue advanced talent of the same name. If the spy has the slippery mind ability from another class, these abilities stack, but she can still only use slippery mind once per round. <br /><br /><strong>Shift Alignment (Su)</strong>: Starting at 6th level, a master spy's control over her aura improves. When she assumes a false alignment, she can choose to have all spells and magic items affect her as though she were that alignment; this includes helpful and harmful effects. For example, a neutral good master spy can shift her aura to lawful evil so she can pass through a doorway that shocks creatures that aren't lawful evil; if hit by <em>holy smite </em>with this shifted aura, she takes damage as if she were evil. A master spy can change her alignment aura from a masked alignment (as per her 2nd-level class feature, where effects still function based on her actual alignment) to a shifted alignment (as per this ability, where effects function based on her assumed alignment) as a standard action. Shifting her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect. <br /><br /><strong>Death Attack (Ex)</strong>: At 8th level, a master spy learns the art of killing or paralyzing a foe with a careful strike. This ability functions as the assassin's death attack ability. If the master spy has levels in another class that grants the death attack ability, these levels stack with her master spy level to determine the DC of her death attack, even if she has not yet reached 8th level as a master spy. <br /><br /><strong>Fool Casting (Su)</strong>: A master spy of 8th level or higher can trick an opponent into believing that she has been charmed or dominated. When the master spy succeeds at a saving throw against a magical effect that provides ongoing control (such as <em>charm person</em>, <em>dominate person</em>, or a vampire's dominate ability), she can allow the spell to take partial effect. To the caster, it appears that the spy failed her saving throw, but the spy is not under the caster's control. If the spell provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but the spy is under no obligation to follow the caster's commands. The master spy can dismiss a fooled spell as a standard action. Fooled casting can be used when the spy succeeds at a subsequent saving throw against an ongoing effect, such as that granted by slippery mind. <br /><br /><strong>Hidden Mind (Sp)</strong>: At 9th level, a master spy gains the benefit of a constant <em>mind blank </em>spell at a caster level equal to her character level. The spy can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the <em>mind blank </em>for 1d4 rounds. <br /><br /><strong>Assumption (Su)</strong>: The ultimate ability of the master spy is to take over another persona entirely, making it her own. As a full-round action, the spy can touch a helpless creature and shift her aura to that of her target.

If she is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus.<br /><br /><strong>Deeds (Ex)</strong>: This ability functions exactly as the swashbuckler ability of the same name with two exceptions. First, the devoted muse qualifies for and benefits from deeds as if she were a swashbuckler 3 levels lower than her class level (minimum 1). Second, the devoted muse doesn&rsquo;t gain the opportune parry and riposte deed until 4th level. For the purpose of this ability, a devoted muse&rsquo;s class levels otherwise stack with levels in any other class that grants the deeds ability.<br /><br /><strong>Panache (Ex)</strong>: This ability functions exactly as the swashbuckler ability of the same name. For the purpose of this ability, a devoted muse&rsquo;s class levels stack with levels in any other class that grants the panache ability.<br /><br /><strong>Artistic Flourish (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, when a devoted muse has at least 1 panache point and successfully feints against an opponent in combat, instead of denying the opponent its Dexterity bonus, she can instead create one of the following effects (all of which are mind-affecting effects). A creature can be affected by only one such effect at a time, and imposing a second effect immediately ends the first. The DC of any saving throws to resist these effects is equal to 10 + the devoted muse&rsquo;s class level + her Charisma modifier.<br /><br /><em>Distracted</em>: The target treats all other creatures as though they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all attack rolls (even if the creature has blindsight). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the devoted muse&rsquo;s Charisma modifier, though a successful Will save reduces the duration to 1 round.<br /><br /><em>Confused</em>: At 5th level, the devoted muse can cause the target to be confused for 1 round (Will negates). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this artistic f lourish again for 1 day.<br /><br /><em>Staggered</em>: At 5th level, the devoted muse can cause the target to be staggered for 1 round (Will negates). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this artistic f lourish again for 1 day.<br /><br /><em>Dazed</em>: At 8th level, the devoted muse can spend 1 panache point to cause the target to be dazed for 1 round (Will negates). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this artistic f lourish again for 1 day.<br /><br /><strong>Harmonious Strike (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, when a devoted muse hits a creature affected by her artistic flourish ability, she can spend 1 panache point to perform an especially elegant attack. She selects one of the effects below to modify this harmonious strike.<br /><br /><em>Circling Strike</em>: After the attack, the devoted muse can move 5 feet as a free action as long as she ends her movement within the target&rsquo;s reach (or former reach, if the attack incapacitated it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step. If she attacked with a weapon whose critical multiplier is &times;3 or higher, she can instead move 10 feet in this way. <em>Deadly Strike</em>: The attack deals an additional 1d4 points of damage. This extra damage increases by 1d4 every 2 devoted muse levels after 2nd level (maximum 5d4). This is precision damage and isn&rsquo;t multiplied on a critical hit. If her weapon&rsquo;s critical multiplier is &times;3, the size of these bonus damage dice increases by one step to 1d6. If her weapon&rsquo;s critical hit multiplier is &times;4, the die size increases to 1d8.<br /><br /><em>Inspirational Strike</em>: At 6th level, the devoted muse can inspire her comrades with her attack, granting her allies (including herself ) within 30 feet a competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls until the end of her next turn. This bonus is equal to her weapon&rsquo;s critical modifier (i.e., +2 for &times;2, +3 for &times;3, etc.). If her attack was a critical hit, these benefits last a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier.<br /><br /><em>Masterful Strike</em>: At 10th level, the devoted muse can feint against one creature within her reach as a free action after resolving the attack. If she performs an artistic f lourish with this feint against a distracted target, the target&rsquo;s miss chance against the devoted muse increases by an amount equal to 5 &times; her weapon&rsquo;s critical multiplier.<br /><br /><strong>Feinting Feat</strong>: At 3rd level and every 3 class levels thereafter, a devoted muse gains one of the following as a bonus feat: Disengaging Feint<sup>UC</sup>, Disengaging Flourish<sup>UC</sup>, Feint Partner<sup>UC</sup>, Greater Feint, Improved Feint Partner<sup>UC</sup>, Passing Trick<sup>UC</sup>, Skill Focus (Bluff ), Twinned FeintACG, or Wave Strike<sup>UC</sup>. The devoted muse must meet the prerequisites for the feat selected.<br /><br /><strong>Limitless Art (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, a devoted muse starts each day with 1 additional panache point, and her maximum number of panache points increases by 1. At 7th level and again at 10th level, the number of additional panache points increases by 1.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.4mRcoVTsYkOEIYhS","dataType":"compendium","name":"Artful Defense (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-disarm.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Y6Z1r9mFjoN7S9ZI","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deeds (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-disarm.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.tMweJRTIHe5y5Xqw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Panache (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-disarm.jpg","level":1,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.eCz4wuetgyn1PllQ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Harmonious Strike (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-disarm.jpg","level":2,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pXT77hNPBPca0T2B","dataType":"compendium","name":"Artistic Flourish (Su)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-disarm.jpg","level":2,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FrcpF9B5SuA9HSxF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Limitless Art (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-disarm.jpg","level":4,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.riVZmvaNkrk7hLre","dataType":"compendium","name":"Feinting Feat","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/greater-disarm.jpg","level":3,"_index":6}]},"tag":"devotedMuse","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":true,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":true,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

additional weapon or armor proficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Counter-Summons (Su)</strong>: A Riftwarden can ready an action to use a <em>summon monster </em>spell or spelllike ability as a counterspell, even though the casting time for a <em>summon monster </em>spell is 1 full round. When used this way, the <em>summon monster </em>spell is treated as though quickened to a swift action via the Quicken Spell metamagic feat, though its spell level is not increased, and it can be used only to counterspell. When used to counterspell, a <em>summon monster</em> spell can counter any conjuration (summoning) spell or spell-like ability of its level or lower, including an outsider&rsquo;s summon ability.<br /><br />At 5th level, this ability can be used as an immediate action, without the need to ready an action beforehand.<br /><br /><strong>Planar Guide (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level and every three levels thereafter, a Riftwarden chooses one of the following benefits. She may choose each benefit more than once, each time applying to a different plane or outsider subtype. These bonuses stack with similar bonuses from other classes, but unlike with a ranger&rsquo;s abilities, these bonuses do not escalate when new enemies or terrains are selected.<br /><br /><em>Favored Enemy</em>: Choose one outsider subtype as a favored enemy (as the ranger class feature).<br /><br /><em>Favored Terrain</em>: Choose one plane other than the Material Plane as favored terrain (as the ranger class feature).<br /><br /><em>Terrain Mastery</em>: Choose one plane to gain terrain mastery (as the horizon walker class feature; <em>Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide </em>265). A Riftwarden must have the appropriate plane as a favored terrain before gaining terrain mastery with it.<br /><br /><strong>Planar Channel (Su)</strong>: At 2nd level, a Riftwarden can channel baneful energies against creatures with the extraplanar subtype, regardless of alignment or plane of origin, as the cleric&rsquo;s channel energy ability. The Riftwarden deals damage as a cleric of a level equal to her highest caster level. This energy can only harm, not heal. This ability cannot be used with feats, magic items, or other effects that modify channel energy. A Riftwarden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her bonus for the relevant ability of the spellcasting class she selected.<br /><br /><strong>Eradication (Su)</strong>: At 3rd level, a Riftwarden gains a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws against the spells and spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities of outsiders. In addition, she increases by 1 the save DC and caster level of any spell or spell-like or supernatural ability that she uses against outsiders, or that counters, dispels, or prevents planar travel or teleportation. These bonuses increase by +1 for every three levels after 3rd.<br /><br /><strong>Counterport (Su)</strong>: At 4th level, a Riftwarden can ready an action to counterspell a teleportation effect that allows a creature to enter or exit an area within 30 feet of her. She can use Spellcraft to identify a teleportation effect immediately as creatures arrive and can counter the teleportation effect with an identical spell or with any conjuration spell of at least 1 spell level higher, returning teleporting creatures to their point of origin.<br /><br /><strong>Planar Scourge (Su)</strong>: At 5th level, an extraplanar creature that fails its save against the Riftwarden&rsquo;s planar channel gains the panicked, sickened, or staggered condition, chosen by the Riftwarden, for 1d4 rounds.<br /><br /><strong>Improved Counterport (Su)</strong>: At 7th level, a Riftwarden can use her counterport ability to forcibly redirect a creature using a teleportation effect within 30 feet to a new valid destination within 30 feet of her. The wrenching redirection deals 1d6 points of damage per class level to the redirected creature. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the Riftwarden&rsquo;s character level + the Riftwarden&rsquo;s Cha modifier) halves the damage and negates the redirection. In addition, when a conjuration effect causes a creature to appear in a square threatened by the Riftwarden, that creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the Riftwarden.<br /><br /><strong>Planar Purge (Su)</strong>: At 8th level, an extraplanar creature that fails its save against a Riftwarden&rsquo;s planar channel is banished to its home plane (as the <em>banishment </em>spell; no save). Extraplanar creatures with Hit Dice greater than twice the Riftwarden&rsquo;s class level are unaffected by this ability, but still take damage from planar channel as normal.<br /><br /><strong>Greater Counterport (Su)</strong>: At 10th level, a Riftwarden can counter a teleportation effect as an immediate action, without the need to ready an action beforehand. In addition, as a full-round action, the Riftwarden can expend two uses of her planar channel ability to forcibly recall a creature that used teleportation to exit an area within 30 feet of the Riftwarden since the end of the Riftwarden&rsquo;s last turn. Planar channel deals damage equal to the amount normally dealt by one use of planar channel. This damage affects only that target, and affects it regardless of its current distance from the Riftwarden. If the target fails its save, the teleportation effect is reversed and the creature returns to the point from which it teleported (or the nearest available space, if that space is now occupied by another creature).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.cSFBSk8Ip7FNa4tr","dataType":"compendium","name":"Counter-Summons (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.drBNHx5qPTdOsrTO","dataType":"compendium","name":"Planar Guide (Ex)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.pYelp6JBKNR9Bh9O","dataType":"compendium","name":"Planar Channel (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.wMZRhD7D4VayGNx0","dataType":"compendium","name":"Eradication (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.d7UBzMRSgdJL9JMV","dataType":"compendium","name":"Counterport (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.KcZ7mKrEiatDQ742","dataType":"compendium","name":"Planar Scourge (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.bg5EbEwPgGdfRSmF","dataType":"compendium","name":"Improved Counterport (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":7,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.yXlT5ba9rbeULUqa","dataType":"compendium","name":"Planar Purge (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":8,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.GFFiWJ5OPlCyDE54","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Counterport (Su)","img":"icons/environment/wilderness/portal.webp","level":10,"_index":8}]},"tag":"riftwarden","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"med","skillsPerLevel":4,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":true,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":true,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

But those who seek to most closely emulate the traditions created by Sirian Aldori usually do so by taking levels in the Aldori swordlord prestige class. When one hears of an Aldori swordlord traveling the back roads, confronting bandits and defeating braggarts by challenging them to single combat, that swordlord has very likely pursued this path.<br /><br />Due to this prestige class&rsquo;s emphasis on mastering numerous feats, Aldori swordlords often have levels in the fighter class; many of these are humans with above-average intelligence, which helps them swiftly fulfill the skill requirements, but this is far from the only route available. Rangers, rogues, slayers, and swashbucklers also seek to master this signature swordfighting art by gaining levels as an Aldori swordlord, even though, in most cases, they must wait longer to qualify for the class than fighters. Many of an Aldori swordlord&rsquo;s abilities rely or build on rules presented in <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</em>, which includes rules for duels. This prestige class also works well in conjunction with the Aldori defender archetype presented on page 22, though neither the archetype nor the prestige class require the other.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become an Aldori swordlord, a character must fulfill the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Dazzling Display, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword), Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword). <br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Acrobatics 3 ranks, Intimidate 5 ranks, Knowledge (nobility) 3 ranks, Sense Motive 3 ranks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Aldori Swordlord's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Perform (Cha), and Sense Motive (Wis).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Deft strike, quick draw</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Display weapon prowess</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Defensive parry +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Adaptive tactics 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Shatter confidence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Saving slash</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Defensive parry +2, dexterous duelist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Adaptive tactics 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Greater saving slash</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 10.5744%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6137%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.8007%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.6145%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.3408%;\">Confounding duelist</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the Aldori swordlord prestige class. Unless stated otherwise, the following benefits apply only when a swordlord is wielding an Aldori dueling sword (see page 24) and carrying nothing in his other hand.<br /><br /><strong>Deft Strike (Ex)</strong>: An Aldori swordlord can add his Dexterity bonus (if any) to damage rolls made with an Aldori dueling sword instead of his Strength bonus. This bonus on damage rolls applies whether the swordlord is wielding an Aldori dueling sword one-handed or two-handed. An Aldori swordlord cannot use this ability if he is wielding a shield or using an off-hand weapon (including armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons).<br /><br /><strong> Quick Draw</strong>: An Aldori swordlord gains Quick Draw as a bonus feat. If the character already has this feat, he instead gains Aldori Dueling Mastery (see page 24). If he already has both feats, he instead gains a combat feat of his choice as a bonus feat. The Aldori swordlord must meet all prerequisites of the selected combat feat.<br /><br /><strong> Display Weapon Prowess (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, an Aldori swordlord adds a bonus equal to half his class level on Intimidate checks while using Dazzling Display with an Aldori dueling sword. He also gains an additional +1 bonus on these Intimidate checks for each of the following feats he has with the Aldori dueling sword: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, or Weapon Specialization. The bonuses stack with each other (the total bonus is considered a competence bonus).<br /><br />When involved in a duel, an Aldori swordlord&rsquo;s mastery of elaborate strikes and stances grants him a bonus equal to half his class level on performance combat checks (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</em> 154). These tricks can also be of great help in countering an enemy during a duel, granting him a bonus equal to half his class level on rolls to attempt a dueling parry or to use dueling resolve (<em>Ultimate Combat</em> 152).<br /><br /><strong> Defensive Parry (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, an Aldori swordlord gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC when making a full attack with an Aldori dueling sword. This AC bonus increases to +2 at 7th level. If an Aldori duelist is also a fighter with the Aldori defender fighter archetype (see page 22), levels in this class stack with his fighter levels when determining the AC bonus from this ability.<br /><br /><strong> Adaptive Tactics (Ex)</strong>: At 4th level, an Aldori swordlord learns to adapt his fighting style to counter his enemy&rsquo;s strengths. An Aldori swordlord reduces the attack roll penalty for fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise by 1 at 4th level and by 2 at 8th level. In addition, after an Aldori swordlord uses his Aldori dueling sword to attack a creature he attacked during the previous round, as a swift action he can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + the opponent&rsquo;s base attack bonus). If successful, the swordlord gains a +2 circumstance bonus either on attack rolls or to his AC against that creature until the beginning of his next turn.<br /><br /><strong> Shatter Confidence (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, an Aldori swordlord can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize his target as a swift action after he confirms a critical hit or succeeds at a disarm, reposition, or sunder combat maneuver with an Aldori dueling sword. If his target is already shaken, the swordlord can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target as a swift action after any successful melee attack or combat maneuver. If he succeeds at this check, any morale bonuses the target has are suppressed for a number of rounds equal to the Aldori swordlord&rsquo;s class level. Suppressed effects are not dispelled, and they resume after this time elapses if their duration has not expired. Suppressed morale bonuses include those gained from a barbarian&rsquo;s rage ability; however, this ability doesn&rsquo;t end rage, nor does it suppress other effects of rage or rage powers that do not provide morale bonuses (thus, it doesn&rsquo;t cause a barbarian to become fatigued unless the barbarian chooses to end the rage during the suppressed duration, in which case fatigue from rage affects the barbarian normally).<br /><br /><strong> Saving Slash (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, when wielding an Aldori dueling sword, an Aldori swordlord can use an immediate action to try deflecting a melee critical hit targeting him, reducing its damage to that of a normal hit, with a 25% chance of success. This does not stack with the fortification special ability of magical armor or similar effects.<br /><br /><strong> Dexterous Duelist (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, an Aldori swordlord with at least one free hand is not denied his Dexterity bonus when attempting Acrobatics or Climb checks, nor does he provoke attacks of opportunity when standing up from prone.<br /><br /><strong>Greater Saving Slash</strong>: At 9th level, an Aldori swordlord&rsquo;s saving slash has a 50% chance of reducing a melee critical hit to a normal hit. In addition, he can attempt a saving slash against ranged critical hits, including those from rays and other ranged touch effects, with a 25% chance of success.<br /><br /><strong> Confounding Duelist (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, an Aldori swordlord who successfully uses shatter confidence also suppresses the target&rsquo;s competence and insight bonuses.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TtUzLh8gJY7t6yde","dataType":"compendium","name":"Deft Strike (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.PwZmhhar1Hvu9xvc","dataType":"compendium","name":"Quick Draw","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.qXqveaxXmdvqE8e8","dataType":"compendium","name":"Display Weapon Prowess (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Jbiv5xT0ip0BtJNN","dataType":"compendium","name":"Defensive Parry (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Gun8tm1n9255FnsA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Adaptive Tactics (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":4,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.W839WfRqz0YmiKQj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Shatter Confidence (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":5,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.SMMHL72nX7j6eeGM","dataType":"compendium","name":"Saving Slash (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":6,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.np715EoYCA2wpccA","dataType":"compendium","name":"Dexterous Duelist (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":7,"_index":7},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.rwrh4rMtZx8LTvwJ","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Saving Slash","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":9,"_index":8},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.ihtaQP6tcUnroYWp","dataType":"compendium","name":"Confounding Duelist (Ex)","img":"icons/weapons/swords/shortsword-broad-engraved.webp","level":10,"_index":9}]},"tag":"aldoriSwordlord","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"low"},"ref":{"value":"high"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":true,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"conditionals":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Aldori Swordlord","range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}

So if you want to survive your time in the pit, make sure the people get their blood, and lots of it. If you&rsquo;re lucky enough, the audience will be on your side, you&rsquo;ll feel the roar of the crowd pounding in your chest, and nothing can stop you.<br /><br />This simple philosophy is what separates a true pit fighter from the rest of the castoffs and washed-up gladiators found in arenas all across Golarion. Whether battling beasts in the filthy pits of Belkzen, or combating summoned fiends in the coliseums of Westcrown, a true pit fighter makes sure the audience sees the difference.<br /><br />While pit fighters&rsquo; lives might seem defined by their profession, some do manage to escape the pits, either by winning their freedom in battle or by breaking their chains in the night. Though they may no longer be pit fighters by profession, they will always be pit fighters at heart, and often long for the excitement of battle and the roar of the crowd years after they&rsquo;ve officially retired.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To qualify to become a pit fighter, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.<br /><br /><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any nonlawful.<br /><strong>Feats</strong>: Dazzling Display.<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: Intimidate 5 ranks; Perform (act), Perform (comedy), or Perform (dance) 3 ranks.<br /><strong>Special</strong>: Orc ferocity racial trait or the rage class feature.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Skills</h2>\n<p>The Pit Fighter's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), and Perform (Cha).<br /><br /><strong>Skill Points at each Level</strong>: 2 + Int modifier.<br /><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"width: 96.9314%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\"><strong>Base Attack Bonus</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\"><strong>Fort Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\"><strong>Ref Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\"><strong>Will Save</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\"><strong>Special</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Poor equipment, showmanship 1/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Arena weapon expertise +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Weapon trick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Showmanship 2/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Arena weapon expertise +2, roar of the crowd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Tricky assault</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Showmanship 3/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Arena weapon expertise +3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Brutal trick</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 7.11288%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.0268%;\">+10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.68343%;\">+5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.75233%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 9.49721%;\">+3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 46.5549%;\">Greater roar of the crowd, showmanship 4/day</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The following are class features of the pit fighter prestige class.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</strong>: Pit fighters are proficient with all simple and martial weapons with the performance quality, as well as with light and medium armor and shields (excluding tower shields).<br /><br /><strong>Poor Equipment (Ex)</strong>: Pit fighters are often forced to fight with poorly maintained equipment. At 1st level, a pit fighter can spend a swift action to ignore the broken condition of a single weapon or piece of armor he wields or wears for the remainder of the encounter. The selected weapon or piece of armor is treated in all ways as though it did not have the broken condition, though its hit points remain unchanged. The pit fighter can affect only one item at a time with this ability; if he selects a second item, the first immediately regains the broken condition.<br /><br /><strong>Showmanship (Ex)</strong>: Once per day at 1st level, a pit fighter can treat a regular combat as a performance combat (<em>Ultimate Combat </em>153), with the crowd&rsquo;s starting attitude being indifferent. He makes performance checks, may use performance feats, and takes bonuses or penalties based on the crowd&rsquo;s reaction as normal, even if there is no crowd actually watching the fight. Only the pit fighter is affected by this ability. Activating this ability is a swift action. The encounter&rsquo;s CR determines the DC of the pit fighter&rsquo;s performance checks, as summarized in the table below.<br /><br /></p>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Starting or Current Attitude</strong></td>\n<td><strong>DC to Improve Attitude</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hostile</td>\n<td>15 + CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unfriendly</td>\n<td>10 + CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Indifferent</td>\n<td>5 + CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friendly</td>\n<td>10 + CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Helpful</td>\n<td>15 + CR</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The pit fighter can use this ability one additional time per day at 4th level and every three levels thereafter (to a maximum of four times per day at 10th level).<br /><br /><strong>Arena Weapon Expertise (Ex)</strong>: At 2nd level, when using a weapon with the performance quality, a pit fighter gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls and on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level and to +3 at 8th level.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon Trick (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, a pit fighter gains Improved Dirty Trick<sup>APG</sup> as a bonus feat, and can use any weapon with the performance quality to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver (<em>Advanced Players Guide </em>320). Once per round when the pit fighter performs a dirty trick maneuver against an enemy, he may deal damage to the enemy as if he had struck it with his normal melee attack. The pit fighter must be wielding a weapon and have at least one hand free to use this ability.<br /><br /><strong>Roar of the Crowd (Ex)</strong>: At 5th level, the roar of applause spurs a pit fighter on to greater acts of violence and brutality. When fighting a performance combat, the pit fighter can enter a rage (as per the barbarian class ability) during any round in which the crowd&rsquo;s attitude toward him is helpful. This is in addition to the normal bonuses the crowd&rsquo;s attitude provides. The pit fighter can maintain his rage each round so long as the crowd&rsquo;s attitude toward him remains helpful. If the crowd&rsquo;s attitude ever drops below helpful, the pit fighter&rsquo;s rage immediately ends (though if he possesses the rage ability from another class, he may expend a round of his rage to continue the effect as normal for that class feature). If, after using this ability, the crowd&rsquo;s attitude ever drops to unfriendly or hostile, the pit fighter becomes fatigued. He remains fatigued for as long as the crowd remains unfriendly or hostile or until the end of the combat, whichever comes first.<br /><br /><strong>Tricky Assault (Ex)</strong>: At 6th level, a pit fighter gains Quick Dirty Trick<sup>UC</sup> as a bonus feat. This allows the pit fighter to perform a single dirty trick combat maneuver in place of one of his melee attacks on his turn. He must choose the melee attack with the highest base attack bonus to make the dirty trick combat maneuver.<br /><br /><strong>Brutal Trick (Ex)</strong>: At 9th level, a pit fighter gains Greater Dirty Trick<sup>APG</sup> as a bonus feat. In addition, a creature that spends a standard action to remove a condition applied by the pit fighter&rsquo;s dirty trick combat maneuver provokes an attack of opportunity from the pit fighter.<br /><br /><strong>Greater Roar of the Crowd (Ex)</strong>: At 10th level, the crowd&rsquo;s effect on a pit fighter grows even more pronounced. The pit fighter may enter and maintain a rage so long as the crowd&rsquo;s attitude toward him is friendly or better. If the crowd&rsquo;s attitude is helpful, the morale bonus to the pit fighter&rsquo;s Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. Additionally, after using this ability, the pit fighter does not become fatigued until the crowd&rsquo;s attitude becomes hostile.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":["Prestige Class"],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false},"links":{"children":[],"classAssociations":[{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.zhV7BZUxgN3DtaAy","dataType":"compendium","name":"Poor Equipment (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/double-slice.jpg","level":1,"_index":0},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.TGVoED2T0lNS486U","dataType":"compendium","name":"Showmanship (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/double-slice.jpg","level":1,"_index":1},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.9ewVQ2Nd8oySPajt","dataType":"compendium","name":"Arena Weapon Expertise (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/double-slice.jpg","level":2,"_index":2},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.FUuqBcdhHSe8aDHw","dataType":"compendium","name":"Weapon Trick (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/double-slice.jpg","level":3,"_index":3},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.1h9Lyof28bnOmx0W","dataType":"compendium","name":"Roar of the Crowd (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/double-slice.jpg","level":5,"_index":4},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.7QDKjXOc1lUYaCrT","dataType":"compendium","name":"Tricky Assault (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/double-slice.jpg","level":6,"_index":5},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.fX6ltZ99o8ASu8yj","dataType":"compendium","name":"Brutal Trick (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/double-slice.jpg","level":9,"_index":6},{"id":"pf1e-archetypes.pf-prestige-features.Rri3YSr1swAx2Jwe","dataType":"compendium","name":"Greater Roar of the Crowd (Ex)","img":"systems/pf1/icons/feats/double-slice.jpg","level":10,"_index":7}]},"tag":"pitFighter","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":["lgt","med","shl"],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":["sim","mar"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"classType":"prestige","level":1,"hd":10,"hp":10,"bab":"high","skillsPerLevel":2,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"low"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0,"notes":""}},"classSkills":{"acr":true,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":true,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":true,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":true,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1},"size":"med"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"T7ruBbHuMiFYUDxv":3},"flags":{}}
