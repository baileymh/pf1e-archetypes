These bonus spells replace the shigenjo&rsquo;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.<br /><br />Ki Pool (Su): At 7th level, a shigenjo gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the shigenjo&rsquo;s ki pool is equal to 1/3 her oracle level + her Charisma modifier. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the shigenjo possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, ki points gained from the shigenjo class stack with those gained from the other class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is permanent. The shigenjo can use ki points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a ki pool.<br /><br />As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, a shigenjo can make a ki strike as a monk whose level is equal to her oracle level &ndash; 3.

She treats her oracle level as her monk level for this ability, and the DC is based on her Charisma bonus instead of her Wisdom bonus.<br /><br />Final Revelation: Upon reaching 20th level, you achieve true enlightenment and becomes one with the celestial spirits. You gain the ability to speak with any creature that uses a language. For a number of days equal to your Wisdom score, you can ignore the negative effects of extreme weather, starvation, thirst, and exhaustion. If you die, your powerful connection to the celestial realm allows you to be reborn 3 days later (as reincarnate).

However an oracle becomes black-blooded, her divine powers carry within them the weird power of this chilling magical substance. A black-blooded oracle has the following class features.<br /><br />See the sidebar on the facing page for rules on the black blood itself, but note that a black-blooded oracle does not require access to this eldritch substance to function.<br /><br />Curse of Black Blood (Su): All black-blooded oracles effectively share the same curse&mdash;the curse of black blood. The material affects these oracles physically and mentally, altering both physiology and mystic powers. The blood of a black-blooded oracle actually runs black, and wounds she suffers are infected by her own power and are difficult to heal. She is immune to the effects (both beneficial and destructive) of black blood. Positive and negative energy affect a black-blooded oracle as if she were undead&mdash; positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her (this aspect of the curse has no effect if the oracle is undead). The curse also dulls the oracle&rsquo;s coordination somewhat, imparting a &ndash;4 penalty on all Dexterity-based skill checks. At 5th level, she gains cold resistance 5. This increases to cold resistance 10 at 10th level, and immunity to cold at 15th level. This ability replaces the oracle&rsquo;s curse.<br /><br />Black Blood Revelations: All black-blooded oracles have access to the following revelations, regardless of what mystery they choose.<br /><br />Black Blood Spray (Su): As an immediate action whenever a black-blooded oracle takes piercing or slashing damage, she can cause some of her black blood to spray from the wound to strike any adjacent target. She must make a touch attack to hit the target (if she&rsquo;s attacking the creature that caused the wound, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on her attack roll). If she hits, she deals 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per 2 oracle levels she possesses. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1/day).<br /><br />Dark Resilience (Su): The black blood flowing through a black-blooded oracle&rsquo;s veins gives her resistance to many effects to which undead are immune. Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever she fails a saving throw against an ability drain, a death effect, disease, energy drain, paralysis, or poison, she may attempt that saving throw again with a +4 circumstance bonus. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th level, she can use this ability twice per day. At 15th level, she can use the ability 3 times per day.<br /><br />Darkvision (Ex): A black-blooded oracle gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The range increases to 90 feet at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Black Blood of Orv</h2>\n<p>Black blood wells from the walls of a singular vault deep in Orv, a region known quite aptly as the Land of Black Blood. This noxious fluid repulses and freezes all natural life, although certain creatures like aberrations, undead, and black-blooded oracles possess an uncanny immunity to its effects. Any other creature that comes into contact with black blood takes 1d6 points of cold damage&mdash;10d6 points of cold damage per round if fully immersed.<br /><br />Although black blood isn&rsquo;t itself inherently evil, a pint of black blood can be used as unholy water. A spellcaster who consumes a dose of black blood casts all necromantic spells at +1 caster level for the next 10 minutes, but takes 3d6 points of cold damage and 1 point of Constitution damage by drinking the stuff. Normally, a dose of black blood becomes inert an hour after being harvested from the source in the Land of Black Blood, losing all mystical properties. Gentle repose can preserve up to 1 gallon of black blood&rsquo;s magical properties for increased lengths of time, but no other method of stabilizing the stuff has yet been developed. The blood of a black-blooded oracle is diluted and does not have the properties of full-strength black blood.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Oracle","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_09.jpg","_id":"I5P3digdTTFxMJjq"}

As an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, the divine numerologist can take the average of a single roll of one or more dice, averaging each die separately (for example, the average of a d20 roll is 10, the average of 3d6 is 9, and so on).

While most might be content with their strange powers, some oracles and sorcerers join the Pathfinders specifically to find out more about their mysteries and bloodlines and determine the genesis and history of their eldritch talents. These spellcasters are known among the Spells as seekers, after their obsession with researching ancient texts and obscure ruins for any clues they can find about their heritage and histories. A seeker has the following class features. <br /><br />Tinkering (Ex): Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical items in order to learn more about their oracle mysteries or sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and weird, a seeker gains Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also possesses levels in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels stack with his oracle or sorcerer levels for determining his overall bonus on these skill checks. For an oracle, this ability replaces all of the bonus class skills he would otherwise normally gain from his mystery. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces his bonus Eschew Materials feat. <br /><br />Seeker Lore (Ex): By 3rd level, a seeker has already learned much about his mystery or bloodline, and is more comfortable using the bonus spells gained by that mystery or bloodline. He gains a +4 bonus on all concentration checks, on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance, and on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks made on topics associated with his bonus spells. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 3rd level. <br /><br />Seeker Magic (Su): At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his mystery or bloodline spells with metamagic. When a seeker applies a metamagic feat to any bonus spells granted by his mystery or his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat&rsquo;s spell level adjustment by 1. Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only increases the spell&rsquo;s effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not stack with similar reductions from other abilities. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 15th level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 15th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Oracle","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_09.jpg","_id":"X2F84WQRxd3bj8PW"}

The powerful bond formed with a river is also the river soul oracle&rsquo;s curse, as he must always carry water from the river with him, and his fate is bound to it. River soul oracles can be gentle and still when calm, but they&rsquo;re raging torrents when angered.<br /><br />Class Skills: A river soul oracle adds Escape Artist, Knowledge (nature), Survival, and Swim to his list of class skills.<br /><br />This replaces the class skills granted by the oracle&rsquo;s mystery and alters the oracle&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Recommended Mysteries: Life, nature, stone, waves.<br /><br />Bonus Spells: Hydraulic push (2nd), hydraulic torrent (6th), control water (8th), cone of cold (10th), world wave (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle&rsquo;s mystery bonus spells at these levels.<br /><br />River Bound Curse (Su): You bind your power to one particular river, which is the source of your spells and class abilities. You must carry a small vessel containing water from the river you are bound to at all times. If the vessel is destroyed or travels more than 10 feet away from you, you are unable to cast oracle spells or use your supernatural or spell-like class abilities until you recover the vessel or fill a new one with water from the river to which you are bound. Once per month, you can bond with a different river in a ceremony at that river that takes 12 hours to complete. You lose your bond with the previous river in the process.<br /><br />This replaces oracle&rsquo;s curse.<br /><br />Revelations: A river soul oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels.<br /><br />River Flow (Su): At 1st level, as a free action while you are underwater, you can negate the penalties you take for making bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing melee attacks underwater. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The rounds do not have to be used consecutively. River Form (Su): At 11th level, you can become one with a river. Once a day as a standard action, while immersed in a river, you can completely merge with it. Your body and all your gear meld into the water, as per meld into stone, except abilities that control or shape water expel you and deal you 5d6 damage rather than abilities that control or shape stone. You travel along with the river at the rate it is currently moving. You can remain in this form a number of hours equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Transforming back to your normal form is a swift action.<br /><br />River Soul Revelation (Su): At 20th level, you strengthen your ties to the river with which you bonded. While traveling on or immersed in the river, you gain fast healing 10 and immunity to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Additionally, if you are slain and your body or some part of your body (including your ashes, if applicable) is floated down the river in a specially prepared vessel costing 5,000 gp, you return to life as per resurrection once you reach the mouth of the river, as long as the trip has taken 24 hours or longer.<br /><br />This replaces final revelation.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Oracle","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/red_09.jpg","_id":"XGMAMtg2Ar8fDAB4"}

A few practitioners develop a talent for Pei Zin that transcends ordinary alchemy, allowing them to blur the line between applying alchemical medicine and coaxing divine miracles.<br /><br />Like other masters of the art, Pei Zin practitioners can use the Profession (herbalist) skill in place of Craft (alchemy) to create alchemical remedies with recipes that include certain plant-derived reagents. More information is on pages 24&ndash;25 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual.<br /><br />Master Herbalist (Su): A Pei Zin practitioner has mastered countless alchemical techniques that supplement her divine powers and greatly aid her when she heals the sick and wounded. She gains a competence bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1), and uses her Charisma modifier in place of her Wisdom modifier when attempting Profession (herbalist) checks. Additionally, a Pei Zin practitioner can identify potions as if via detect magic using Profession (herbalist) instead of Spellcraft, and she can attempt such a check after holding a potion for 1 round.<br /><br />This ability replaces the additional class skills the oracle gains from her mystery.<br /><br />Healer&rsquo;s Way (Su): A Pei Zin practitioner combines alchemy, acupuncture, and divine magic to heal wounds by touch. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, she uses positive energy to heal the target of 1d6 hit points for every 2 oracle levels she has. Using this ability is a standard action unless the oracle targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Using this ability requires only one free hand. This ability counts as a paladin&rsquo;s lay on hands ability for the purposes of feats, spells, and effects that work with that class feature when it is used for healing purposes. Unlike lay on hands, this ability cannot be used to harm undead.<br /><br />This ability replaces the revelation gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Master Healing Technique (Su): At 7th level, whenever a Pei Zin practitioner heals a living creature with her healer&rsquo;s way ability, as a free action she can attempt a Profession (herbalist) check to remove a condition from the target, with each condition having an accompanying Profession (herbalist) DC (see the list below). She cannot take 10 or 20 on this check, nor can she receive aid from any creature except another Pei Zin practitioner (though the practitioner need not be an oracle; see pages 24&ndash;25 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual). Failure by 5 or more causes the target to become sickened for 1 round (if the Pei Zin practitioner is attempting to remove the sickened condition, this extends it by 1 round).
