{"name":"Mesmerist (Umbral Mesmerist)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Occult Realms pg. 16</a><br />Trained in secret, umbral mesmerists are clandestine weapons who spend years learning how to shape terrifying creatures from the inky darkness in which they revel.<br /><br />Diminished Spellcasting: An umbral mesmerist can cast one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number of spells for a level to 0, he can cast spells of that level only if his Charisma score allows bonus spells of that level. This ability alters the mesmerist&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Shadow Summoning (Sp): An umbral mesmerist gains the ability to summon quasi-real creatures as per summon monster I a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The umbral mesmerist can use this ability as a standard action, and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). The creatures summoned are only partly real, but have normal effects unless a creature affected by the illusion succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve (as per shadow conjuration.) The DC for this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the umbral mesmerist&rsquo;s mesmerist level + the umbral mesmerist&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. This is an illusion with the shadowUM descriptor.<br /><br />A shadow creature has half the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it is recognized as a shadow creature). It deals the normal amount of damage and has all of the base creature&rsquo;s normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature&rsquo;s damage is halved, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 50% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature&rsquo;s AC bonuses are halved. A creature that succeeds at its save to disbelieve sees the summoned creature as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell. The umbral mesmerist cannot use this ability to summon creatures from more than one summon monster spell in this way at one time.<br /><br />At 4th level and every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by 1 spell level, allowing the umbral mesmerist to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster VI at 20th level). This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.<br /><br />Umbral Solipsism (Su): At 2nd level, when a creature attempts a Will save to disbelieve a quasireal creature created by shadow summoning, it takes a penalty on the save equal to the mesmerist&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (minimum 0). This ability replaces towering ego.<br /><br />Ephemeral Stare (Su): At 5th level, the umbral mesmerist is treated as if he were invisible by the target of his hypnotic stare (as per the invisibility spell), provided neither he nor any creatures conjured by shadow summoning take hostile actions against the target. Once the umbral mesmerist or any creature conjured by his shadow summoning ability takes a hostile action against the target, the mesmerist becomes visible to the target and the target cannot be affected again by that umbral mesmerist&rsquo;s ephemeral stare ability for 24 hours (although it can be affected by other effects of his hypnotic stare). This ability replaces mental potency.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"1OU2pn6zVD0xi4k3"}

These mesmerists are known as vexing tricksters.<br /><br />Consummate Trickster (Ex): A vexing trickster gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 3 mesmerist levels thereafter (maximum +6).<br /><br />This ability replaces consummate liar.<br /><br />Trickster&rsquo;s Ego (Ex): At 2nd level, a vexing trickster gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat.

At 6th level, the vexing trickster can implant up to two modified mesmerist tricks in a single target simultaneously. At 14th level, he can implant up to three modified mesmerist tricks in a single target simultaneously.

This alters the mesmerist&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Martial Weapon Proficiency (Ex): At 1st level, a vexing daredevil picks one martial weapon and becomes proficient in its use. This ability replaces the 1st-level mesmerist trick.<br /><br />Bonus Feats: A vexing daredevil gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat at 3rd level, Greater Feint as a bonus feat at 6th level, and Greater Mesmerizing Feint* as a bonus feat at 10th level. She doesn&rsquo;t need to meet the prerequisites for these feats. At 14th level, she gains a bonus stare feat; she must meet the prerequisites of that feat. These bonus feats replace touch treatment.<br /><br />Dazzling Feint (Su): At 3rd level, each time a vexing daredevil successfully feints against a creature under the effect of her hypnotic stare, she also chooses one of her dazzling feint benefits to activate. Unless otherwise stated, a dazzling feint&rsquo;s benefit applies only on the vexing daredevil&rsquo;s next attack this round. She selects one dazzling feint at 3rd level and another every 4 levels thereafter. The DC for any saving throw against a dazzling feint&rsquo;s effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vexing daredevil&rsquo;s class level + her Charisma modifier. The vexing daredevil can&rsquo;t choose the same dazzling feint more than once.<br /><br />Blinding Strike: The vexing daredevil&rsquo;s weapon emits a bright flash of light into the opponent&rsquo;s eyes. If the vexing daredevil&rsquo;s next attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.<br /><br />Combat Maneuver: The vexing daredevil&rsquo;s attack patterns become more difficult to discern. The vexing daredevil chooses one combat maneuver when making this dazzling feint. For the rest of the round, she doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity when performing that combat maneuver against the target of her dazzling feint. This dazzling feint benefit applies on combat maneuvers instead of on the vexing daredevil&rsquo;s next attack.<br /><br />Critical Strike: Ever alert, the vexing daredevil hones in on the target&rsquo;s weak points. If her next attack is a critical threat against the target of this dazzling feint, the vexing daredevil gains a circumstance bonus on the roll to confirm that critical hit equal to +1 for every 3 mesmerist levels she possesses.<br /><br />Outmanuever: The vexing daredevil&rsquo;s darting movements foil the target&rsquo;s attempts to box her in. If her next attack hits, the vexing daredevil gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through the target&rsquo;s space or threatened area for 1 round. She can also move up to half her speed after the attack hits as a free action. If she wants to use Acrobatics to move through the target&rsquo;s threatened area or an enemy&rsquo;s space during this movement, she must reduce her speed or the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 10, as normal.<br /><br />Piercing Strike: By psychically amplifying the target&rsquo;s pain, the vexing daredevil causes more damage. If she hits with her next attack and deals damage with her painful stare, she increases the damage dice from d6s to d8s.<br /><br />Sloppy Defense: The vexing daredevil&rsquo;s attacks effortlessly penetrate the target&rsquo;s defenses; she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next attack roll for every 5 mesmerist levels she possesses.<br /><br />Surprise Strike: The vexing daredevil creates an opening so she can squeeze in another strike. If her next attack hits, she can make another attack at her highest attack bonus &ndash; 5 as a free action. The vexing daredevil must be at least 7th level to select this dazzling feint. This ability replaces bold stare.<br /><br />Shimmering Body (Sp): At 11th level, when a vexing daredevil moves in a round, until the beginning of her next turn, any target of her hypnotic stare sees her as a constantly shimmering form of light and treats her as if she were under a blur spell.

From sibilant whispers to overwhelming imprecations that resonate with the force of pure will, a vox unleashes the power of his mind with every silken syllable and shattering shout.<br /><br />Spells: A vox adds the following spells to his class list: 1st&mdash;ear-piercing screamUM; 2nd&mdash; cacophonous callAPG, disrupt silenceUI, distracting cacophonyUM, piercing shriekUM, sonic screamACG; 4th&mdash;shout, sonic thrustUM, wall of soundUM; 5th&mdash;cacophonous call (mass) APG, echolocationUM, resonating wordUM; 6th&mdash; magnifying chimeACG, shout (greater), sonic formACG. Unlike most psychic spells, a vox&rsquo;s mesmerist spells use both thought and verbal components; like a bard, a vox cannot remove the verbal components of his spells.<br /><br />This alters the mesmerist&rsquo;s spellcasting and replaces towering ego, the mesmerist trick normally gained at 10th level, and touch treatment (break enchantment).<br /><br />Compelling Voice (Su): A vox can focus the sound of his voice on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action, sapping that target&rsquo;s willpower and rendering her more vulnerable to mind-affecting powers, rather than using a stare like other mesmerists. A vox can use his compelling voice even while deafened, but it has a 20% chance to fail, just like casting a spell with a verbal component. The target does not need to be able to understand what the vox is saying, but does need to be able to hear the sound of the vox&rsquo;s voice (for instance, this ability cannot be used if either the vox or his target is in an area of magical silence). Otherwise, the vox&rsquo;s compelling voice has the effects of the standard mesmerist&rsquo;s hypnotic stare, and it gains further benefits as normal from abilities like the painful stare and bold stare class features.<br /><br />This ability alters hypnotic stare.<br /><br />Wounding Words (Su): At 3rd level, a vox can focus the power of his voice to magnify the force of his blows in melee. As a standard action, a vox can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of sonic damage plus 1 point per mesmerist level. Alternatively, he can make a single attack with a melee weapon as a standard action, adding the listed sonic damage to the damage dealt by his weapon on a successful attack. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. If the target of the vox&rsquo;s wounding words is also the target of his compelling voice, that creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vox&rsquo;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or take a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round. This penalty doesn&rsquo;t stack with the effects of the Concussive SpellUM metamagic feat.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch treatment (minor) and touch treatment (moderate).<br /><br />Subsonic Strike (Su): At 10th level, a vox is able to unleash a deadly flurry of his wounding words as a standard action. He can target a number of creatures or objects equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1) within 30 feet, requiring a ranged touch attack against each target. If the target of his compelling voice is within 30 feet, he can choose to instead target only that creature with a single ranged touch or melee touch attack, dealing double normal damage on a successful attack. Whatever choice he makes, the vox must expend one use of wounding words.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch treatment (major).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"DICrh5YeO60yg9Dw"}

At each of the indicated levels, a projectionist must choose the indicated spell to learn&mdash;he cannot choose other spells. The spells that a projectionist must learn (and the level at which he must choose them) are enter imageAPG(4th), lesser object possessionOA (7th), riding possessionOA (10th), object possessionOA (13th), and greater object possessionOA (16th). The projectionist adds greater object possession to his spell list as a 6th-level spell.<br /><br />This ability alters the mesmerist&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Implant Consciousness (Su): At 4th level, a projectionist can spend one use of his mesmerist trick ability to create a psychic link between himself and one object that bears his likeness, such as a painting or a statue. This functions in all ways like implanting a mesmerist trick in a creature, except the target is an object. The projectionist can trigger the trick as a standard action at any time&mdash;upon doing so, his consciousness leaves his body and fills the target object, functioning as described by the &ldquo;filling an image with your consciousness&rdquo; use of the enter image spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide 219). Use the projectionist&rsquo;s mesmerist level as the spell&rsquo;s caster level. While filling an image with his consciousness, the projectionist can use and maintain his hypnotic stare on opponents, and can also trigger his painful stare. At 8th level, he can also use any purely mental action (including casting psychic spells) while filling an object with his consciousness.<br /><br />Once he implants this trick in an object, the projectionist can fill the target with his consciousness whenever he pleases, regardless of distance or whether he is on the same plane as his target. Once he stops concentrating on maintaining the enter image effect, his consciousness returns to his body and he cannot fill the target with his consciousness again until he implants another mesmerist trick in that object.<br /><br />This ability replaces the mesmerist tricks gained at 4th and 8th levels.<br /><br />Hidden Presence: At 5th level, a projectionist gains Hidden PresenceOA as a bonus feat. He doesn&rsquo;t need to meet the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites. He benefits from Hidden Presence and feats that list Hidden Presence as a prerequisite while possessing objects (as with object possessionOA) or while filling an object with his consciousness (as described in the enter imageAPG spell), as well as when he possesses creatures, provided the feat is applicable. For instance, Intrusive PresenceOA cannot be used to read the mind of an inanimate object possessed via enter image or object possession, as objects possess no minds to be read.<br /><br />This ability replaces the mesmerist&rsquo;s mental potency.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"J09M446pNlMOlYM2"}

This bonus is equal to the thought eater&rsquo;s mesmerist level, and lasts for 24 hours, or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.<br /><br />This ability replaces consummate liar.<br /><br />Assume Morality (Su): At 2nd level, the thought eater&rsquo;s alignment matches that of the target of his assume identity ability for the purposes of spells and effects that discern alignment. This includes any increase to alignment aura strength from class features, such as a cleric&rsquo;s aura ability.<br /><br />This ability replaces towering ego.<br /><br />Assume Knowledge (Su): At 3rd level, the thought eater can choose one Knowledge skill possessed by the target of his hypnotic stare. He uses the target&rsquo;s number of ranks in that skill, instead of his own, to calculate his bonus (but not for other purposes, such as meeting the prerequisites of feats) to a maximum number of ranks equal to his mesmerist level. This ability lasts for 24 hours or until he uses his hypnotic stare ability on a different creature.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch treatment.<br /><br />Consume Identity (Su): At 20th level, when the thought eater kills a target of his hypnotic stare, he can choose to entirely consume the creature&rsquo;s identity, mind, body, and soul as a free action. The target&rsquo;s corpse dissolves and as long as the thought eater lives, the target of consume identity cannot be brought back from the dead until the thought eater releases the identity (a standard action) or uses consume identity on another target. The creature&rsquo;s soul can also be released by a wish or miracle (which ends the effect of consume identity). When the thought eater has consumed an identity, all divination spells identify him as (and consider him to be) the creature whose identity he consumed rather than himself. This ability fools any spell short of discern location.

A gaslighter who becomes nonevil cannot gain new levels as a mesmerist but retains all his class abilities.<br /><br />Consummate Cruelty: A gaslighter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) on Intimidate checks. A gaslighter can take Improved Dirty TrickAPG and Greater Dirty TrickAPG without having Combat Expertise or an Intelligence score of 13. He can also ignore those two prerequisites for other feats that have Improved Dirty Trick or Greater Dirty Trick as a prerequisite.<br /><br />This ability replaces consummate liar.<br /><br />Horrid Mask (Su): At 3rd level, as a standard action, a gaslighter can implant a maddening phantasm in the mind of the target of his hypnotic stare, causing the target to perceive its own reflection as corrupted in some disturbing way. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and there is no saving throw. The target is simultaneously captivated and horrified by the sight of its own reflection, and in any round in which the target can see itself in a mirror within 30 feet, the gaslighter can trigger his painful stare against the target without dealing damage. This is a gaze attack, and the creature can avert its eyes to attempt to avoid it. Any creature holding a visible mirror that attempts to demoralize the target can choose to add the gaslighter&rsquo;s Charisma modifier to its Intimidate check instead of its own. Horrid mask lasts until that particular hypnotic stare ends (often when the target moves away from a mirror). The gaslighter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch treatment (minor) and alters painful stare.<br /><br />Phantasmal Force (Su): At 6th level, a gaslighter can force the target of his horrid mask ability to recoil from its reflection. Whenever the gaslighter uses horrid mask, if an affected target begins its turn adjacent to a mirror, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the gaslighter&rsquo;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) or be compelled to either flee from the mirror (or the creature holding it) to beyond 30 feet or attempt to destroy the mirror (or the creature holding it). This is a gaze attack, and the target can attempt to avert its eyes.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch treatment (moderate).<br /><br />Phantasmal Foes (Su): At 10th level, a gaslighter can spend one use of his horrid mask ability as a standard action to convince the target of his hypnotic stare that it is surrounded by foes only it can see. The target is treated as flanked for any melee attacks against it until the hypnotic stare ends. The gaslighter can use either this ability or horrid mask during a particular hypnotic stare, but not both at once. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch treatment (greater).<br /><br />Corosion of Sanity (Su): At 14th level, whenever a creature fails its initial saving throw against a gaslighter&rsquo;s singletarget mind-affecting effect, the target also takes 1 point of Wisdom damage. This has no effect on abilities that don&rsquo;t allow a saving throw or affect multiple targets or an area. If using the sanity system (see page 12), the target takes 2 points of sanity damage instead.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch treatment (break enchantment).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"QL9evaZMg5BH5QpB"}

This ability alters painful stare.<br /><br />Somnomancer: At 1st level, a dreamstalker gains the slumberAPG hex. The dreamstalker&rsquo;s effective witch level is equal to her mesmerist level, and she can activate them only by expending two daily uses of mesmerist tricks. The save DCs for her hexes are Charisma-based. She can take certain additional hexes in place of mesmerist tricks, selecting nightmaresAPG or visionAPG at 10th level and higher, or eternal slumberAPG at 18th level and higher.<br /><br />When she would normally gain a new mesmerist trick, she can learn additional spells instead. Each time she does so, she adds two of the following spells of a level she can currently cast to her list of spells known: 1st&mdash;oneiric horrorOA, sleep; 2nd&mdash;detect mindscapeOA, greater oneiric horrorOA, instigate psychic duelOA; 3rd&mdash;deep slumber, minor dreamOA; 4th&mdash;create mindscapeOA, dream, forgetful slumberARG, mindscape doorOA, sleepwalkARG, sleepwalking suggestion (see page 127); 5th&mdash;cloak of dreams, dream councilOA, dream scanOA, symbol of sleep, waves of fatigue; 6th&mdash;dream travelOA, greater create mindscapeOA, waves of exhaustion.<br /><br />This alters mesmerist tricks and replaces the 1st-level mesmerist trick.<br /><br />Sleepless (Ex): At 2nd level, a dreamstalker gains immunity to sleep effects and a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus on saving throws against fatigue and exhaustion. She loses both benefits when under an effect that would prevent her from providing an emotion component (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 144).<br /><br />This replaces towering ego.<br /><br />Touch of Night (Su): A dreamstalker can&rsquo;t remove shaken, frightened, sickened, cowering, nauseated, or panicked conditions using her touch treatment. However, she can remove fatigue or magical sleep (other than hard-to-remove magical sleep such as the eternal slumberAPG hex) as a minor condition, staggered as a moderate condition, and exhausted as a greater condition. As normal, removing fatigue or exhaustion only removes the condition, not the underlying cause, such as lack of sleep.<br /><br />This ability alters touch treatment.<br /><br />Dreamwalker (Su): At 5th level, a dreamstalker treats dreamscapes as a favored terrain, as per the ranger ability, gaining a +2 bonus that increases by 2 every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th. While in a dreamscape, she also treats any creature from the Dimension of Dreams (including dreamed figments) as her favored enemy, with a bonus equal to 1/2 her favored terrain bonus.<br /><br />This ability replaces manifold tricks.<br /><br />Tramautic Spell: At 11th level, a dreamstalker gains Traumatic SpellOA as a bonus feat.<br /><br />This ability replaces glib lie.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"QRkwMPiZJDsgx9ug"}

Others believe themselves to be truly in touch with an unknown power, bringing their unique messages to those willing to follow and obey them.<br /><br />Insidious Personality (Ex): A cult master adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Diplomacy checks. This ability replaces consummate liar.<br /><br />Fanatical Stare (Su): At 1st level, a cult master can turn his gaze on a creature to fill it with fervent belief in the cult master. The target of the gaze gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 mesmerist levels the cult master possesses, to a maximum of +4 at 18th level. Instead of taking the hypnotic stare&rsquo;s penalty on Will saves, the target gains a bonus of an equal amount on Will saves. The bonuses don&rsquo;t apply to attacks against the cult master or on saves against the cult master&rsquo;s spells or abilities. The cult master can also suppress any penalties inflicted by his stare for the target. This ability replaces painful stare.<br /><br />Cult Tricks (Su): The following new tricks can be selected by a cult master. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.<br /><br />Double: An illusion makes either the cult master&rsquo;s cohort or one of his followers appear to be him. The cult master can trigger this trick when he is targeted by an attack, provided he is adjacent to the subject, to give the attack a 50% miss chance. If the attack misses the cult master, it targets the subject instead. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.<br /><br />Extol: A mental compulsion causes a cohort or follower to extol the virtues of the cult master. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he attempts a Diplomacy check, as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject takes the aid another action on the cult master&rsquo;s Diplomacy check. If the subject is successful, the cult master gains a +4 bonus on his check. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.<br /><br />This ability alters mesmerist tricks.<br /><br />False Healing (Su): At 3rd level, a cult master can provide temporary healing by using his psychic powers to trick the mind a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the cult master uses it on himself ), and the cult master must be able to touch his target. The cult master grants a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + his Charisma modifier to the target. At 6th level, the cult master can either grant a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + his Charisma modifier to the target or temporarily remove 1d4 points of ability damage. A creature can receive the effect of the false healing only once per day. The temporary hit points or reduction in ability damage lasts a number of hours equal to the cult master&rsquo;s class level. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 6th-level touch treatments.<br /><br />Faithful Followers (Ex): At 7th level, a cult master begins to attract followers to his espoused beliefs, thanks to his magnetic personality. The cult master gains Leadership as a bonus feat. This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.<br /><br />Fanatical Devotion (Ex): At 10th level, a cult master has manipulated his cohort and followers into becoming utterly devoted to him. The cult master no longer takes a penalty to his Leadership score for being aloof or cruel. Additionally, the DCs of all enchantment spells the cult master casts on his cohort and followers increase by 4. At 14th level, the cult master no longer takes a penalty to his Leadership score for any cohorts or followers he has killed or caused to be killed. This ability replaces the 10th- and 14th-level touch treatments.<br /><br />Masterful Cult Tricks (Su): The following new master tricks can be selected by any cult master of 12th level or higher. These tricks can be implanted only in a cohort or follower of the cult master.<br /><br />Avenge Me: The cult master creates a compulsion for one of his followers to avenge him. Whenever the cult master takes hit point damage from an attack, he can trigger this trick as long as he is within 60 feet of the subject. The subject is immediately affected as if by the rage spell for 1 round per mesmerist level.<br /><br />Die for Me: The cult master instills within either his cohort or one of his followers the desire to give her life for him. The cult master can trigger this trick whenever he would take hit point damage from an attack, spell, or effect and the subject is with 60 feet of him. Half the damage is psychically transferred to the subject. This is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.<br /><br />This ability alters masterful tricks.<br /><br />Reborn (Su): At 20th level, a cult master can ensure his own survival upon his death. The cult master can perform a 1-hour ceremony costing 5,000 gp in rare materials in which he uses his psychic powers to implant a small portion of his essence into his cohort, who must be a minimum of 17th level. When the cult master dies, in 7 days the cohort physically and mentally transforms into the cult master as if clone had been cast, except that the cohort&rsquo;s body takes the place of the inert body. The cult master can&rsquo;t use this ability again until he gains a new cohort of at least 17th level and performs the necessary ceremony. The cohort can&rsquo;t be brought back to life except through miracle or wish.

While the target of a mesmerist&rsquo;s hypnotic stare might not realize that the mesmerist is the source of the strange thoughts invading his mind, an enigma takes that mental obfuscation to a more extreme level. Enigmas often end up serving as master spies and infiltration experts.<br /><br />Solipsism (Su): At 1st level, whenever the enigma uses hypnotic stare on a creature, instead of applying a penalty on the creature&rsquo;s saving throws, the enigma begins to fade from the creature&rsquo;s view. Until the enigma&rsquo;s next turn, the enigma gains the effects of concealment against that creature (unless it can see invisible creatures). Starting on the enigma&rsquo;s next turn, he gains the effect of invisibility against that creature. These effects last as long as the enigma continues to use his hypnotic stare, but if he takes an action that would end invisibility, it ends his hypnotic stare immediately. The enigma can reinstate this effect whenever he wishes, but each time it begins with 1 round of concealment. At 8th level, attacks that would end invisibility do not end the enigma&rsquo;s hypnotic stare, and after 1 round of concealment, he gains the benef its of greater invisibility against the target of his stare. For the purpose of bold stare improvements, the enigma&rsquo;s hypnotic stare always has a penalty of &ndash;1.<br /><br />This ability alters hypnotic stare.<br /><br />Veiled Steps: An enigma gains a bonus to his Stealth checks equal to 1/4 his mesmerist level (minimum +1).<br /><br />This ability replaces consummate liar.<br /><br />Enigmatic Stare (Su): The target of an enigma&rsquo;s hypnotic stare takes a &ndash;4 penalty on Perception checks to notice the enigma. At 8th level, this penalty increases to &ndash; 6.<br /><br />This ability replaces painful stare.<br /><br />Transfer Affliction (Su): At 3rd level, the enigma can afflict others with the harmful conditions that he endures. This ability functions as the touch treatment ability, but can only be used to remove harmful conditions from the enigma, not other creatures. In order to remove these harmful effects, the enigma must succeed at a touch attack against another creature. The creature touched gains the chosen harmful effect for whatever duration it would have afflicted the enigma and the effect is removed from the enigma, unless the creature succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the enigma&rsquo;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier). Using this ability is always a standard action. At 14th level, the enigma can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of bestow curse, delivered as a touch attack as part of using this ability. Transfer affliction is a mind-affecting effect.<br /><br />This ability alters touch treatment.<br /><br />Sneak Attack (Ex): At 5th level, an enigma gains the sneak attack ability of a rogue. This sneak attack damage is +1d6 at 5th level, and increases by +1d6 every 4 mesmerist levels thereafter.<br /><br />This ability replaces manifold tricks.<br /><br />Detection Void (Su): At 11th level, an enigma can elude detection spells (spells with &ldquo;detect&rdquo; in their name). A creature using this sort of magic against the enigma must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + the enigma&rsquo;s class level to succeed (as if the enigma was under the effect of a nondetection spell); failure means the magic fails to detect the enigma, as if he did not exist.<br /><br />This ability replaces glib lie.<br /><br />Absentia (Su): At 20th level, all creatures adjacent to the enigma subconsciously ignore him. Adjacent creatures are always treated as flat-footed to the enigma and are not considered to be directly observing the enigma for the purpose of the Stealth skill. This effect ends immediately if the enigma makes a successful attack against any creature, but automatically resumes at the beginning of his next turn.<br /><br />This ability replaces rule minds.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"WvtwldM0NQj0ezTG"}

This ability replaces consummate liar.<br /><br />Injections (Su): At 1st level, the toxitician uses his skill with alchemy and his own psychic powers to create injections. The toxitician can create a number of injections per day equal to his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the toxitician attempts to use it, taking a swift action to infuse it with his psychic power to activate it.<br /><br />Using an injection requires taking a standard action to attempt a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a &ndash;2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the toxitican&rsquo;s class level (minimum 1). The penalty becomes &ndash;3 at 8th level. The toxitician can simultaneously attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to inject the target surreptitiously. If the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand, the target can attempt a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result, but detecting the attempt doesn&rsquo;t prevent the creature from being injected. Whenever the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand to administer one of his injections, he can implant it rather than injecting it and then trigger the effect of the injection at a later time. At any point before he regains his injections, the toxitician can trigger an implanted injection as a free action. The toxitician must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per mesmerist level) of the target of the implanted injection.<br /><br />If either the melee touch attack or the Sleight of Hand check (if attempted) fails, the injection isn&rsquo;t delivered but can still be used again&mdash;once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn&rsquo;t been administered becomes inert if it leaves the toxitician&rsquo;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping.<br /><br />The penalties from multiple injections don&rsquo;t stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from mesmerist stares or witches&rsquo; evil eye hexes. Injections are mind-affecting effects.<br /><br />This ability replaces hypnotic stare.<br /><br />Painful Injection (Su): The toxitician&rsquo;s injection causes intense pain. This increases the damage the subject takes in the same way as the mesmerist&rsquo;s painful stare class feature. This extra damage is dealt automatically, without being triggered by the toxitician, but doesn&rsquo;t increase when the toxitician damages the target and can still be dealt only once per round. This ability replaces painful stare.<br /><br />Injection Improvement (Su): At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a toxitician can select one improvement to add to his injections. The toxitician can&rsquo;t choose the same improvement more than once. The toxitician doesn&rsquo;t have to select the improvements when he prepares his injections at the start of the day; the choice is made as part of the swift action to activate the injection. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to resist an injection with an improvement added to it. The DC is 10 + 1/2 the toxitician&rsquo;s class level + the toxitician&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. On a successful save, the target still takes the penalty on its Will saving throws, but not the effects of the improvement. A toxitician can, as a free action, sacrifice one use of his injections to increase the DC of another injection by 2.<br /><br />Ability Decrease: The target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to one ability score of the toxitician&rsquo;s choosing. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &ndash;4.<br /><br />Excruciating: The extra damage from painful injection increases by an amount equal to 2 points + 1 point per 3 mesmerist levels the toxitician possesses.<br /><br />Fortitude Decrease: The target&rsquo;s immune system weakens, imposing a &ndash;2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &ndash;4.<br /><br />Natural Armor Decrease: The target&rsquo;s skin becomes looser, decreasing its natural armor (if any) by 2. At 11th level, its natural armor bonus instead decreases by 4.<br /><br />Reflex Decrease: The target&rsquo;s body becomes stiffer, imposing a &ndash;2 penalty on the target&rsquo;s Reflex saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes &ndash;4.<br /><br />Slow: The target&rsquo;s actions become sluggish, reducing its base movement by 10 feet and imposing a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls. At 11th level, the penalty on attack rolls becomes &ndash;2.<br /><br />This ability replaces bold stare.<br /><br />Treatment Vials (Su): At 3rd level, a toxitician can create treatment vials when he creates his injections for the day; creating each treatment vial expends one use of touch treatment. A treatment vial has the same benefit as his touch treatment, but anyone can administer it as a standard action. A vial can remove any condition the toxitician is able to remove at his mesmerist level, but can&rsquo;t be used for a break enchantment effect. A treatment vial becomes inert after 24 hours. This ability alters touch treatment.<br /><br />Improved Injections (Su): At 11th level, the toxitician can add two different improvements to an injection. The injection still requires only one save.

All creatures within this area, as well as creatures with scent within 30 feet, take a &ndash;2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty becomes &ndash;3 at 8th level. The aroma hovers around the aromaphile, moving with him, and lasts for 1 minute. The hypnotic aroma must be inhaled to be effective, and creatures that choose to hold their breath, do not breathe, or are immune to inhaled poisons are immune to its effect.<br /><br />This replaces hypnotic stare, painful stare, and towering ego.<br /><br />Debilitating Aroma (Su): At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, an aromaphile can imbue his hypnotic aroma with other effects. These effects are the same as those listed within the bold stare mesmerist class feature, but they affect creatures affected by his hypnotic aroma for as long as they are affected by that ability. The aromaphile chooses one option each time he gains a new debilitating aroma improvement, and the choice can&rsquo;t be changed later. The aromaphile can&rsquo;t choose the same debilitating aroma more than once unless otherwise noted.<br /><br />This replaces bold stare.<br /><br />Aromatic Manipulation (Su): At 3rd level, the aromaphile can touch a creature affected by his hypnotic aroma to alter its mental state. This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued to his list of minor conditions and exhausted to his list of greater conditions.<br /><br />An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. At 3rd level, he can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma. At 6th level, he can deaden the target&rsquo;s emotions (as per calm emotions). At 10th level, he can cause the target to become stunned. At 14th level, he can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber, except the Hit Die limit is equal to the aromaphile&rsquo;s level + 2). The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC = 10 + half the aromaphile&rsquo;s level + the aromaphile&rsquo;s Charisma modifier).

He can choose these as spells known, but doesn&rsquo;t gain them automatically. This ability alters the mesmerist&rsquo;s spell list.<br /><br />Undead Inception (Su): At 1st level, a spirit walker can affect undead creatures with his hypnotic stare as the psychic inception bold stare ability. This allows him to affect only undead; he must actually choose the psychic inception bold stare improvement if he wants to also affect other mindless creatures. At 3rd level when the spirit walker uses this ability, undead targets don&rsquo;t receive a saving throw bonus (if they did to begin with), have only a 25% chance of ignoring the spirit walker&rsquo;s mind-affecting spells and abilities, and no longer need to be under the spirit walker&rsquo;s gaze to be affected. At 5th level, when the spirit walker uses his mind-affecting spells and abilities, they affect all undead normally, with no chance of failure. This ability replaces consummate liar and mental potency.<br /><br />Continued Animation (Su): At 3rd level, when a spirit walker is using hypnotic stare on a humanoid target and the target dies, as an immediate action the spirit walker can force the target&rsquo;s soul to remain in the body. The spirit walker can then control the target as if using dominate person for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the spirit walker&rsquo;s class level. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 &times; the spirit walker&rsquo;s class level and continues acting as though it were alive and conscious until it loses those temporary hit points or the duration expires. During this time, the creature counts as undead, but it can&rsquo;t be healed by negative energy. The spirit walker can use this ability once per day for every 3 mesmerist levels he possesses. The target receives a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the spirit walker&rsquo;s class level + his Charisma modifier) to avoid this effect and die normally. This ability ends immediately if at any point the target&rsquo;s body is completely destroyed (such as by disintegrate) or restored to life. At 14th level, the spirit walker can apply this ability to any type of target as if using dominate monster. This ability replaces the 3rd- and 14th-level touch treatments.<br /><br />Command Undead (Su): At 6th level, a spirit walker gains Command Undead as a bonus feat. A spirit walker can use Command Undead a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier (minimum 1), using his mesmerist level as his cleric level. At 10th level, the DC to resist this effect increases by 2. This ability replaces the 6th- and 10th-level touch treatments.<br /><br />Master of the Dead (Su): At 20th level, a spirit walker gains mastery of the undead. Once per day, a spirit walker can use control undead as a spell-like ability on one target. If that creature fails its saving throw and has 20 or fewer Hit Dice, it falls permanently under the spirit walker&rsquo;s control until the spirit walker dies. A creature that fails its save but has more than 20 HD suffers the effect of command undead. A creature that succeeds at its save can&rsquo;t be affected by master of the dead for 24 hours. A spirit walker can control only one undead creature in this fashion at a time. If he permanently controls a new undead creature, the previous one is set free.

These dragon-inspired psychic magic-users typically employ draconic imagery in their dress and the manifestations of their powers. <br /><br />Innate Coercion : At 1st level, a mindwyrm mesmer gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) on Intimidate checks. In addition, a mindwyrm mesmer never takes penalties on Intimidate checks for being smaller than his target. <br /><br />This ability replaces consummate liar. <br /><br />Phantasmagorical Breath (Su): At 1st level, a mindwyrm mesmer has learned to mimic a true dragon&rsquo;s destructive breath using his psychic ability. A number of times per day equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 1 per day), a mindwyrm mesmer can unleash his phantasmagoric breath in either a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line as a standard action. The breath induces a psychosomatic response in creatures caught in the area, dealing 1d6 points of energy damage at 1st level, plus an additional 1d6 points of energy damage at 3rd level and for every 2 mesmerist levels thereafter. The mindwyrm mesmer selects the type of energy damage this deals (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) when this ability is first gained; once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. Creatures affected can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the mindwyrm mesmer&rsquo;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to realize the true nature of the attack, which negates all damage.

A mindwyrm mesmer can trigger this trick when the subject moves adjacent to an enemy. Enemies adjacent to the subject take a -4 penalty on attacks against targets other than the subject. This trick lasts for 1 round per mindwyrm mesmer&rsquo;s mesmerist level. <br /><br />Masterful Draconic Trick (Su): The following new masterful trick can be selected by a mindwyrm mesmer of 12th level or higher. <br /><br />Frightful Countenance: The subject&rsquo;s appearance changes into that which frightens an attacker to the core. The mindwyrm mesmer can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker must succeed at a Will save or the attack misses and the attacker immediately becomes shaken for 1d4 rounds.

Instead, he can spend 5 minutes to implant multiple tricks in a single willing target. The number of tricks he can implant per day is unchanged from the regular mesmerist class, but he can apply as many of those tricks as he chooses on a single use of this ability.<br /><br />If implanting tricks in himself, the caster merely spends 5 minutes in contemplation; otherwise, he consults star charts while ritually asking the creature questions, and still must touch them to do so. At 1st level, he can select multiple instances of the same trick to implant in a single subject.

The number of additional subjects increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he has beyond 5th.<br /><br />Using this ability again on an existing subject or to implant any trick on a new subject ends all previously implanted tricks.

As a result, maintaining his powers against an opponent hinders him as much as his target.<br /><br />Autohypnosis (Su): At 1st level, an autohypnotist has mastered techniques that make his hypnotic stare ability more potent, but at a terrible cost&mdash;the autohypnotist succumbs to his own power when he uses it. Whenever the autohypnotist focuses his stare on an opponent, the penalties that opponent takes from the hypnotic stare (as well as any bold stare improvements or stare feats that the autohypnotist has) increase by 1. However, the autohypnotist takes the same penalties as his target while focusing his stare, including those of any bold stare improvements he has.<br /><br />An autohypnotist can reduce or negate the penalty he imposes upon himself with his hypnotic stare, but doing so allows his opponent an opportunity to escape from the stare as well. The autohypnotist can reduce the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare ability by half for 1 round as a swift action. If he does so, there is a 25% chance that his hypnotic stare ends altogether. Alternatively, he can choose to negate the penalty he takes from his hypnotic stare for 1 round, but his hypnotic stare then has a 50% chance of ending.<br /><br />This ability alters hypnotic stare.<br /><br />Wide Stare (Su): At 5th level, whenever an autohypnotist is focusing his stare on a foe, he can broaden his hypnotic stare as a standard action.

All illusion (glamer), illusion (shadow), and transmutation spells of 6th level and lower are considered to be part of the material manipulator&rsquo;s spell list. These are psychic spells.<br /><br />This ability alters the mesmerist&rsquo;s spellcasting and replaces consummate liar, the mesmerist trick gained at 2nd level, and manifold tricks.<br /><br />Revision (Su): At 3rd level, a material manipulator can revise a creature&rsquo;s body to change its appearance. He can use revision a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using revision is a standard action (or a swift action if the material manipulator uses it on himself ), and the material manipulator must be able to touch his target. An unwilling target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the material manipulator&rsquo;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.<br /><br />At 3rd level, the material manipulator can adjust the target&rsquo;s height and weight, increasing it or decreasing it to any height or weight within the standard range for creatures of the target&rsquo;s type and size category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169). At 6th level, he can adjust the target&rsquo;s gender, physical traits (such as nose size, fingernail length, and foot shape), and pigmentation (including eye, hair, and skin color) to any natural variation for creatures of the target&rsquo;s type (and heritage, if applicable). At 10th level, he can adjust the target&rsquo;s age, rewinding the target&rsquo;s age to as young as a young adult (approximately 8 years old for a human) or progressing it to as old as venerable. This causes the target to gain aging bonuses and penalties and adjust its size as appropriate for its new age, but doesn&rsquo;t confer any other benefits gained from aging (such as additional racial Hit Dice, supernatural abilities, and so on). At 14th level, he can adjust the target&rsquo;s type or subtype, as per polymorph. At 20th level, he can instead adjust the target&rsquo;s type as per greater polymorph. This ability is a polymorph effect, and the subject of a revision cannot end the effect early by any means unless the material manipulator permits it. The material manipulator can stack multiple adjustments from this ability into the same polymorph effect&mdash;for instance, a 14th-level material manipulator can adjust himself into an orc, reduce his age to that of a young adult, give himself large feet and a bulbous nose, and change his gender.<br /><br />This effect lasts for 10 minutes per mesmerist level. At 10th level, the effect lasts for 1 hour per mesmerist level, or 1 minute per level if he uses it as polymorph. At 20th level, the effect lasts indefinitely, or 10 minutes per mesmerist level if the material manipulator uses it as greater polymorph and causes the target to assume a form with a different type than its true form. The mesmerist can dismiss this effect as a free action.<br /><br />Clothing and equipment worn by the target is not affected by this effect&mdash;gear does not resize to suit the wearer&rsquo;s new form, nor does it merge into her body.

An adventuring vizier is delighted that enemies focus on the raging barbarian or spell-slinging wizard first, not realizing the threat posed by the vizier until it&rsquo;s too late.<br /><br />Insidious Influence (Su): A vizier subtly influences his allies and others who trust him, making it more likely they will follow his suggestions. Allies with mesmerist tricks implanted by the vizier take penalties on Will saves made to resist the vizier&rsquo;s abilities and spells, and on Diplomacy, Intimidate, Sense Motive checks attempted against the vizier. This penalty equals that imposed by the vizier&rsquo;s hypnotic stare. If the vizier uses his hypnotic stare against such an ally, these penalties stack.<br /><br />At 3rd level, the vizier automatically gains the susceptibility bold stare improvement, and it also applies to the DCs of any influence check to manipulate the target (even if it isn&rsquo;t Diplomacy or Intimidate).<br /><br />This ability replaces consummate liar and the bold stare improvement gained at 3rd level.<br /><br />Power Behind the Throne (Su): At 2nd level, the vizier can use his mesmerist powers to make it seem like he is just a hanger-on who isn&rsquo;t contributing to a combat or social situation. This includes making it seem like one of his allies is casting his spells instead. When the vizier casts a spell, once the vizier&rsquo;s spell is complete, a glamer subtly alters onlookers&rsquo; memories and perception of the spell&rsquo;s casting such that all the usual manifestations of the spell indicate that the caster was one of the vizier&rsquo;s allies with an implanted trick. Creatures who observed the spellcasting can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vizier&rsquo;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the glamer. Since this effect only comes into play after the spell&rsquo;s casting is complete, any attempts to ready an action against the spellcasting, counterspell, or take attacks of opportunity still work as normal. This ability does not prevent or otherwise hinder creatures from correctly targeting such attacks and abilities against the vizier (for instance, a creature readying an action to shoot an arrow to interrupt the spellcasting would still shoot the vizier). Additionally, when the vizier triggers an ally&rsquo;s implanted trick, flashy effects make it appear as if the ally was using an activated ability of her own.<br /><br />At 5th level, the vizier doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity when using power behind the throne, as if under the effects of a constant illusion of calmUC. A creature that disbelieves this second effect becomes immune to that vizier&rsquo;s illusion of calm for 24 hours.<br /><br />This ability replaces towering ego and mental potency.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"og5BRZMpUzpZAknJ"}

This means that she gains orisons instead of knacks. This doesn&rsquo;t change her number of spells per day or spells known.

If she targets another ally, the fey trickster must be able to contact the ally bodily, usually with a kiss. When she uses her fey veil, the fey trickster subtly alters the appearance and aura of her target, granting one of the powers allowed by her mesmerist level. t 3rd level, she can grant the ally a +2 circumstance bonus on her choice of Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal checks for 1 minute. At 6th level, she can change the ally&rsquo;s form so thoroughly that the ally gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks until the next sunrise (similar to the bonus from disguise self, but it also disguises touch and sound, and it doesn&rsquo;t allow a saving throw to disbelieve).<br /><br />At 10th level, the fey trickster can make the ally and her aura so attractive or repulsive for 10 minutes that the veil automatically adjusts the moods of those who see the ally and fail their saving throw, as telempathic projectionOA. At 14th level, a fey trickster can create a veil so powerful that it fools even reality, granting the full effects of both the 6th-level fey veil and alter self to the target for 1 hour. Each of these abilities, even the 14th-level ability, is an illusion and glamer effect, though the last ability counts as a size-changing polymorph effect for the limit of only one polymorph or size-changing effect on a creature.<br /><br />This ability replaces touch treatment.<br /><br />One with the Fey: At 20th level, a fey trickster fully transforms into a fey, though she can still choose to count as her original creature type as well whenever it would be advantageous to her (such as if she is a humanoid and wishes to be affected by reduce person). She gains low-light vision as well as an additional ability depending on which type of fey she chooses to most closely associate with. Some examples follow.<br /><br />Erlking: The fey trickster is constantly under the effects of haste.<br /><br />Nymph: The fey trickster gains the nymph&rsquo;s unearthly grace ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 217)<br /><br />Quickling: The fey trickster gains the quickling&rsquo;s supernatural speed ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 227).<br /><br />Rusalka: The fey trickster gains the rusalka&rsquo;s tresses ability and four tress primary natural attacks similar to those of a rusalka (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 232).<br /><br />This ability replaces rule minds.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"thMvTDht09LUUzpd"}

A hate-monger who becomes good cannot gain new levels as a mesmerist but retains all his class abilities.<br /><br />Mental Manipulator (Ex): A hate-monger masters a broad repertoire of emotional corruption. At 1st level, he adds one spell from the 1st-level spells below to his spells known. When he would gain a new mesmerist trick, he can learn additional spells instead, adding two of the following spells of a level he can currently cast to his spells known: 1st&mdash;cause fear, compel hostilityUC, delusional prideUM, demand offeringOA, forbid actionUM, lesser confusion, murderous commandUM, scare, sow thoughtARG; 2nd&mdash;aversionOA, paranoiaOA, rage, unadulterated loathingUM; 3rd&mdash; confusion, crushing despair, curse of disgustUM, fear, instant enemyAPG, malicious spiteUM, smug narcissismUM, spiteAPG; 4th&mdash;envious urgeUM, feast on fearARG, greater forbid actionUM, modify memory, utter contemptUM; 5th&mdash;foe to friendAPG, foster hatredOA, song of discord, repress memoryOA, unwilling shieldAPG, vengeful outrageUM; 6th&mdash; eyebite, insanity, overwhelming presenceUM, symbol of persuasion. When he casts a spell he learns in this way, he increases the duration as if his caster level were 1 higher. Starting at 5th level, the save DC is increased by 1 for creatures of his favored enemy type.<br /><br />This ability replaces consummate liar and alters mesmerist tricks.<br /><br />Insidious Hatred (Su): At 3rd level, a hate-monger can sow hatred and strife under the pretense of assisting others. He can use his touch treatment only on others, but as part of the action of using touch treatment, he can cast any targeted spell from the mental manipulator list that does not have a range of &ldquo;personal&rdquo; and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less, targeting only the creature that receives his touch treatment. That creature doesn&rsquo;t realize the hatemonger has cast a spell, and considers any manifestations to be part of the touch treatment. Other creatures notice as normal. The target creature takes a &ndash;2 penalty on its saving throw and to its spell resistance against the spell.<br /><br />This ability alters touch treatment.<br /><br />Xenophobe (Ex): At 5th level, a hate-monger can choose one favored enemy, as per the ranger class feature. His favored enemy bonus begins at +2 and increases by 2 for every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th, but he does not gain additional favored enemies. His favored enemy bonus also applies on Intimidate checks against his favored enemy.<br /><br />This ability replaces mental potency and manifold tricks.<br /><br />Out for Blood (Ex): At 7th level, when a creature takes extra damage from the hate-monger&rsquo;s painful stare, it also takes 1 point of bleed damage (or 1 point of bleed damage per 1d6 points of damage dealt by the painful stare if the hatemonger damages the target himself ). This bleed damage does not stack with itself or other sources of bleed damage.<br /><br />This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.<br /><br />Insidious Emotions (Su): At 11th level, the power of a hatemonger&rsquo;s psychic hold becomes more difficult to detect or to break. The DC of Sense Motive checks to notice if a creature is under the effects of his enchantments with the emotionUM descriptor increases by 5 (if he also has the Subtle EnchantmentUI feat, the effects stack), as does the DC to identify his emotion spells. Magical divinations can detect his emotion effects only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11 + the hate-monger&rsquo;s mesmerist level) as if the affected creatures were the subject of nondetection.<br /><br />This ability replaces glib lie.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"zWYkujAIBdfOMbyU"}

Eyebiters take this a step further. An eyebiter&rsquo;s eyes become so infused with psychic might that they can leave the eyebiter&rsquo;s body and move about on their own.<br /><br />Eyeball Familiar (Ex): An eyebiter imbues one of his eyes with limited sentience, so that he can pluck it out and allow it to move on its own. The eyeball familiar functions similarly to the tumor familiar alchemist discovery (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 17) except as follows. The eyeball familiar does not have fast healing. The eyeball familiar doesn&rsquo;t resemble an animal, and its size is Fine for a Medium or smaller eyebiter (or one size category larger for every size category the eyebiter is larger than Medium). It has a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability) and no physical attacks (though it can still deliver touch spells once the eyebiter has reached 3rd level). The eyeball has a Strength score of 1, a Dexterity score of 12, and a Constitution score of 10. It has no set Hit Die, base saves, or skill ranks of its own, though it uses its master&rsquo;s when a familiar normally would. It doesn&rsquo;t grant its master any familiar bonus, nor can it ever be an improved familiar.<br /><br />Whenever the eyebiter&rsquo;s eyeball familiar leaves his body, he is dazzled until it returns (if it is destroyed, the eyebiter loses that eye until he gains the effects of a regeneration). An eyebiter must have at least one eye to use this ability, and an eyebiter with only one eye is blinded instead of dazzled until his familiar returns.<br /><br />This ability replaces consummate liar and the mesmerist trick gained at 1st level.<br /><br />Ocular Occlusion (Su): At 3rd level, an eyebiter gains the ability to cloud the sight of others with a melee touch attack. He can use this ability as a standard action a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A successful Will save negates the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eyebiter&rsquo;s mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier); this is a mind-affecting ability. If the eyebiter chooses to use an ocular occlusion of a lower level than the highest-level effect he has gained, he can instead use a standard action to target a creature within 30 feet with that effect as a ranged touch attack.<br /><br />Clouded Vision: At 3rd level, the eyebiter can cause the target to become dazzled for 1 minute and suffer a 20% miss chance on all attacks the target makes against opponents within 60 feet. Opponents more than 60 feet away have total concealment from the target.<br /><br />Cause or Cure Blindness: At 6th level, the eyebiter can blind the target for 1 minute or affect it as per the spells remove blindness.<br /><br />Eyeless Horror: At 10th level, the eyebiter creates a powerful illusion that causes the target&rsquo;s eyes to appear as if they have been ripped out, with blood pouring from the sockets. The target is blinded and shaken for 1 round per the eyebiter&rsquo;s mesmerist level, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage each round. The target can attempt a second Will save when attacked to negate the shaken effect and the nonlethal damage.<br /><br />Spellblight: At 14th level, the eyebiter can afflict the target with the ebon eyes, the eldritch cataracts, or the hemoculysis spellblight (Ultimate Magic 95).<br /><br />This ability replaces all instances of touch treatment.<br /><br />Staring Eye (Su): At 5th level, an eyebiter can expend one use of his daily mesmerist tricks to either see through his eyeball familiar as if it were an arcane eye, or to use his hypnotic stare (including related abilities like painful stare and bold stare), as well as any gaze attack he possesses (like burning gaze and eyebite) through his eyeball familiar, as if he were at its location.<br /><br />This ability replaces mental potency.<br /><br />Omnivisual (Ex): At 11th level, an eyebiter&rsquo;s roving eyeball familiar is constantly watching in all directions. As long as his eyeball familiar is outside his body and near enough to see the same things (such as being in the same room), the eyebiter gains all-around vision (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 294) and cannot be flanked.<br /><br />This ability replaces glib lie.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Mesmerist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_15.jpg","_id":"zmtLwRHxruAL054l"}
