He can&rsquo;t choose to channel a weaker spirit to reduce his influence from spirit surge. He does not always possess the seance boon, spirit bonus, spirit powers, or spirit surge ability from any of these six spirits.<br /><br />Instead, he can enter a spirit dance as a free action to gain the aforementioned abilities from one of the six spirits he prepared during his seance for the duration of his spirit dance. He can spirit dance for a total number of rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier + double his medium level; these rounds don&rsquo;t need to be consecutive. After his spirit dance ends, the spirit dancer takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute and can&rsquo;t enter a spirit dance again during that time. He also can&rsquo;t enter a spirit dance while shaken, frightened, or panicked. He combines all influence incurred during spirit dances into a single pool. At 3 points of influence or higher, he takes a &ndash;2 penalty on initiative checks even when he&rsquo;s not in a spirit dance, and at 5 points of influence or higher, his current spirit takes control as it would for a normal medium (this control is not limited by rounds of spirit dance). A spirit dancer can accept 1 point of influence to recover 4 rounds of spirit dance, up to his normal daily maximum.<br /><br />A spirit dancer continues to track daily uses of abilities from each of his spirits even while he is not in a spirit dance. A spirit dancer with the supreme spirit power ability can use only one once-per-day ability from the supreme spirit power each day; he can&rsquo;t use any other spirit&rsquo;s once-per-day supreme spirit power until after his next seance.<br /><br />This ability alters spirit and replaces spirit bonus and spirit surge.<br /><br />Nothing Is Taboo (Ex): A spirit dancer doesn&rsquo;t gain the taboo class feature.<br /><br />Spirit Aura (Su): At 2nd level, a spirit dancer&rsquo;s weaving forms create an aura that grants his current seance boon to all allies within 30 feet. When he grants a seance boon that requires a decision, each ally makes the appropriate decision the first time that ally receives that spirit&rsquo;s aura each day. That decision remains in effect if the ally is affected by that spirit&rsquo;s aura again later that day. This ability replaces shared seance.<br /><br />Spirit Troika (Su): At 15th level, a spirit dancer learns to dance with two partners. When using spirit dance, he can choose to spend 3 rounds of spirit dance each round to gain access to the abilities of any two of the six spirits he prepared during his seance for 1 round. This ability replaces trance of three.<br /><br />Attacca (Su): At 18th level, a spirit dancer learns how to shift rapidly into the next movement of his dance. He no longer takes a penalty after his spirit dance ends and can enter another spirit dance immediately.<br /><br />This ability replaces spacious soul.<br /><br />Dance of Infinite Forms (Su): At 20th level, a spirit dancer has perfected his dance. He can now use each of his supreme spirit powers&rsquo; once-per-day abilities one time each day, instead of just one ability. He can use his spirit troika by spending 2 rounds of spirit dance instead of 3. Finally, he can enter a spirit dance with all six of his prepared spirits at once by spending 4 rounds of spirit dance each round.<br /><br />This ability replaces astral beacon.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"3JwZmnnV0Z8RmaPU"}
{"name":"Medium (Outer Channeler)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qhr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Psychic-Anthology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Psychic Anthology pg. 12</a><br />Rather than invite strange entities and departed souls into their bodies, outer channelers invite extraplanar entities to inhabit them, allowing the likes of angels and demons to use them as vessels in exchange for power. However, this bond always comes with a cost.<br /><br />Outsider Invocation (Su): At 1st level, an outer channeler chooses one outsider subtype from among those listed in the Outsider Spirits section on pages 13&ndash;15. His alignment must be within one step of the outsider&rsquo;s alignment in order to choose it, and once chosen it cannot be changed. Instead of channeling spirits, an outer channeler invokes outsiders of his chosen subtype during his seance.<br /><br />Each subtype lists six outsiders that, when invoked, provide the outer channeler with the same benefits as the outsider&rsquo;s associated spirit. For example, an outer channeler with angel as his chosen subtype can invoke the astral deva, balisse, empyrean, movanic deva, planetar, and solar outsiders, which function like the trickster, hierophant, archmage, champion, marshal, and guardian spirits, respectively.<br /><br />An outer channeler doesn&rsquo;t gain the intermediate power normally granted by his invoked outsider&rsquo;s associated spirit. Instead, he gains the intermediate power noted in his invoked outsider&rsquo;s subtype, regardless of which spirit that invoked outsider is associated with. Furthermore, the outer channeler gains a gift at 13th level, as noted in his invoked outsider subtype.<br /><br />An invoked outsider acts as a spirit for all other effects, including the trance of three and astral beacon class features.<br /><br />This ability alters spirit and spirit power (intermediate).<br /><br />Taboo (Ex): Whenever he invokes an outsider, an outer channeler must accept one taboo from among those listed by his chosen outsider&rsquo;s subtype before the outsider will enter his body. Accepting this taboo provides the outer channeler with no benefits other than those gained from channeling a spirit; if he wishes to gain additional uses of his spirit purge ability as described by the taboo class feature, he must accept a second taboo from among those listed by the legend that his chosen outsider subtype functions as. If the outer channeler breaks this mandatory taboo, the outsider immediately leaves and the outer channeler can&rsquo;t invoke a new outsider until he atones (as per atonement). This ability alters taboo.<br /><br />Shared Seance (Su): An outer channeler&rsquo;s ally cannot gain the seance boon from an outer channeler&rsquo;s outsider spirit if that ally&rsquo;s alignment is more than one step away from the outsider&rsquo;s alignment.<br /><br />This ability alters shared seance.<br /><br />Servitor (Ex): At 3rd level, an outer channeler can summon the spirit of an outsider of his chosen subtype and house it within the body of an ordinary animal. Initially, the outsider takes the form of this animal and acts in all ways as an ordinary familiar of that type. At 7th level, the animal transforms into an outsider, taking the form of an improved familiar with the outer channeler&rsquo;s chosen outsider subtype (such as a cassisian for an angel-invoking medium). The outer channeler doesn&rsquo;t need to meet the prerequisites to gain this improved familiar, and the improved familiar gains the ability to change shape between its outsider form and its animal form at will (as per beast shape II).<br /><br />This ability replaces a medium&rsquo;s haunt channeler and connection channel.<br /><br />Site Channeling (Su): At 5th level, an outer channeler can invoke outsiders from any site tied to any of the following: creatures of his chosen subtype, deities that grant his chosen subtype as a cleric subdomain, or planes that creatures of his chosen subtype are native to. This is in addition to the usual list of sites from which he can channel his outsiders.<br /><br />This ability replaces location channel.<br /><br />Ask the Planes (Sp): At 14th level, an outer channeler gains the ask the spirits ability of the standard medium, except he sends his consciousness to a native plane of his chosen outsider subtype (Heaven for archons, Hell for devils, any good-aligned plane for angels, and so on).<br /><br />This ability alters ask the spirits and replaces astral journey.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"Bo9XWfB7apBHYTlL"}

Rather than simply communing with the wendo like some oracles do, an uda wendo invites the wendo to use his body as a vessel, gaining fantastic powers even while struggling to maintain control of his body against the crushing might of the wendo&rsquo;s presence. <br /><br />Class Skills : An uda wendo adds Knowledge (geography)and Knowledge (nature) to his list of class skills, instead of Perform. <br /><br />This alters the medium&rsquo;s class skills. <br /><br />Wendo (Su) : Rather than channeling spirits, an uda wendo channels the wendo, otherworldly entities that walk among mortals. This functions like channeling a spirit, except instead of requiring a favored location to channel a wendo, an uda wendo must offer the wendo a sacrifice worth at least 50 gp per Hit Die the uda wendo has. Alternatively, the uda wendo can instead accept 1 point of burn, as per the kineticist class ability (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 11), instead of sacrificing material wealth. While channeling a wendo, the uda wendo gains the 1st-level domain power of one druid animal or terrain domain (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 33), or the 1st-level domain power of one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Community, Darkness, Death, Destruction, Earth, Fire, Healing, Knowledge, Protection, Rune, Strength, Sun, Trickery, War, Water, or Weather. The uda wendo has an effective cleric or druid level equal to 1/2 his medium level (minimum 1st) for the purpose of this ability. In addition, he adds all spells from his chosen domain that are of a spell level he can cast (including modifications to the uda wendo&rsquo;s spellcasting from the archmage arcana or divine surge lesser spirit powers) to his medium spell list and medium spells known as medium spells of their domain spell level.<br /><br />An uda wendo cannot invite allies to a seance to summon a wendo, and by channeling a wendo, the uda wendo allows the entity to gain 2 points of inf luence over him. If any sentient creature that doesn&rsquo;t practice juju witnesses the uda wendo&rsquo;s seance, both creatures become permanently cursed with a &ndash;2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks (as per bestow curse) and the attempt fails.<br /><br />This ability alters spirit. <br /><br />Wendo&rsquo;s Secrets (Ex) : At 2nd level, an uda wendo learns most of his information through tales and secrets whispered to him by the wendo. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to all Knowledge checks that he attempts in addition to his Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />This ability replaces shared seance. <br /><br />Wendo Tongue (Su) : At 3rd level, an uda wendo can invoke the wendo to commune with nearby spirits for a number of minutes per day equal to his level. These minutes don&rsquo;t need to be used consecutively, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. The uda wendo can use this ability to speak with corpses (as per speak with dead) at 3rd level, with animals and plants (as per speak with animals or speak with plants) at 5th level, and with humanoids (as per tongues) at 7th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces haunt channeler, location channel, and connection channel.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"CpwfGfZ84Csmg071"}

As the host performs goodly acts, he slowly cleanses the spirit, continuing this process over many generations, until the entity&rsquo;s vileness is no more. In turn, the spirit tempts the fiend keeper with blasphemous power that a cautious medium can direct toward righteous ends. Many tribes boast a resident fiend keeper who bears this local burden and trains replacements who might take over when their mentor dies.<br /><br />Alignment: A fiend keeper must choose a nonevil alignment.<br /><br />Evil Spirit (Su): A fiend keeper serves as the vessel for a powerful evil spirit that fights and bargains for dominance. The legends a fiend keeper channels are all aspects of this evil presence. Willingly performing an evil act automatically grants the evil spirit 1 point of influence over him. Protection from evil temporarily suppresses all the spirit&rsquo;s benefits while the fiend keeper is under the spell&rsquo;s effects. When the spirit gains at least 3 points of influence over the fiend keeper, in addition to the penalties associated with each legend, he gains an evil aura as per a cleric of his level and treats his alignment as evil for the purposes of resisting or being vulnerable to spells and abilities (such as unholy blight or a paladin&rsquo;s smite evil class ability).<br /><br />This ability modifies spirit.<br /><br />Dark Communion (Su): At 3rd level, a fiend keeper can entice the evil spirit to lend him its knowledge or its power as a full-round action a number of times per day equal to his class level. If the fiend keeper seeks knowledge, this behaves as contact other plane using his medium level as his caster level, but if he fails the Intelligence or Charisma check, his spirit gains 1 point of inf luence over him instead of reducing his ability scores. Treat the spirit as an entity from the Astral Plane for this ability. Its knowledge is equivalent to that of a demigod at 5th level, a lesser deity at 7th level, and an intermediate deity at 13th level.<br /><br />If the fiend keeper requests power, he must instead succeed at an Intelligence or Charisma check (DC 10 at 3rd level, DC 12 at 7th level, or DC 14 at 13th level or higher), or his spirit gains 1 point of inf luence over him. Regardless of the outcome, he gains one of the following powers for 1 minute. At 5th level, he also gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his medium level for 1 minute. At 7th level, he selects two powers.<br /><br />Dark Power: The fiend keeper gains a +1 profane bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a +1 profane bonus to AC. At 13th level, these bonuses increase to +2. Fiendish Form: The fiend keeper gains darkvision 60 feet. At 7th level, he grows fiendish wings and gains a fly speed equal to his base speed (average maneuverability). At 13th level, his fly speed instead equals double his base speed (good maneuverability).<br /><br />Natural Attacks: The fiend keeper gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if the fiend keeper is Medium). At 13th level, the damage increases to 1d6 (1d8 if Medium).<br /><br />Spirit Power: The fiend keeper&rsquo;s spirit bonus increases by 1. At 13th level, the spirit bonus instead increases by 2.<br /><br />Unholy Resilience: The fiend keeper gains resistance 5 to two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The resistance increases to 10 at 7th level and 20 at 13th level.<br /><br />This ability replaces haunt channeler, location channel, connection channel, and ask the spirits.<br /><br />Ex-Fiend Keepers: A fiend keeper who becomes permanently evil loses control of the spirit after 1d4+1 days, at which point he becomes an NPC under the GM&rsquo;s full control. Seeking an atonement spell before then can change the medium&rsquo;s alignment. This effect also can be undone with a limited wish, miracle, or wish spell.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"E9yjkRc8khSv6oa4"}

This echo now serves as an appropriate spirit for well-trained mediums to channel. Nex&rsquo;s legendary spirit is more powerful and willful than most legendary spirits, however; it embraces only mediums who visit distinct locations and master opening their third eyes.<br /><br />Legend of Nex (Su): A Nexian channeler gains access to the Nex legendary spirit instead of an archmage spirit. This ability alters the spirit ability.<br /><br />Third Eye (Sp, Su): A Nexian channeler knows one fewer knack than his level would normally indicate, but he gains Third Eye (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 141) as a bonus feat. Beginning at 2nd level, when he selects a taboo, the Nexian channeler can use his third eye for 2 minutes per character level each day, instead of gaining free uses of spirit surge. This ability alters knacks and taboo.<br /><br />Impossible Eye (Su): Starting at 3rd level, a Nexian channeler gains additional powers from his third eye. At 3rd level, while his third eye is open, his caster level for divination spells increases by 1 and he gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. At 5th level, while his third eye is open, he gains constant detect magic. At 7th level, while his third eye is open, he gains constant arcane sight instead of detect magic. At 9th level, while his third eye is open, his bonus on Perception checks against invisible creatures improves to see invisibility. At 13th level, he can concentrate for 1 minute to send his third eye from his body, as per arcane eye (this duration counts against the daily duration for which he can open his third eye, and if the arcane eye is destroyed, he loses all remaining minutes of his third eye ability for that day). At 14th level, as a standard action while his third eye is open, he can spend 1 minute of the duration he can open his third eye to use analyze dweomer on a single target. At 15th level, while his third eye is open, he gains true seeing. At 18th level, while his third eye is open, his arcane sight improves to greater arcane sight. This ability replaces haunt channeler, location channel, connection channel, propitiation, ask the spirits, astral journey, trance of three, and spacious soul.<br /><br />Third Eye Mastery (Su): At 19th level, a Nexian channeler can open his third eye for longer than normal. He can open his third eye for 5 minutes per medium level (increasing to 10 minutes per medium level if he selects a taboo); this duration must be used in 5-minute increments. Uses of analyze dweomer cost him 5-minute increments instead of 1-minute increments, and he can use the read aura occult skill unlock with his third eye multiple times per day; each use takes only 1 minute but costs 5 minutes of the duration he can keep his third eye open. This ability replaces spirit mastery.<br /><br />Living Third Eye (Su): At 20th level, a Nexian channeler is as one with his third eye. It is open at all times, he can use analyze dweomer and the read aura occult skill unlock at will, and the destruction of his arcane eye does not adversely affect him.

A medium of the master can channel that spirit in places of quiet introspection, such as a Darklands grotto, peaceful glade, or windswept peak, in addition to a champion spirit&rsquo;s favored locations.<br /><br />This alters spirit.<br /><br />Dedicated Surge (Su): A medium of the master can use her spirit surge ability twice per day without incurring any influence (this stacks with any additional uses she gains from accepting a taboo, starting at 2nd level). In addition, when she uses spirit surge, the die she rolls is one step larger (1d8 at 1st level, 1d10 at 10th level, and 2d6 at 20th level).<br /><br />This alters spirit surge.<br /><br />Spirit Call (Su): The medium of the master&rsquo;s unique bond allows her to briefly call on a champion spirit without performing a seance. As a standard action, she can allow a spirit to gain 1 point of influence over her to channel it for a number of minutes equal to her level. This influence remains for 24 hours, stacking with any influence the medium gains by using this ability multiple times or by channeling a spirit in a seance during that time.<br /><br />Master&rsquo;s Power (Su): When a medium of the master channels a champion spirit, she treats her unarmed strike damage as that of a <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Monk\">monk</a> of her level. For the purpose of determining damage, these levels stack with levels from any other class that grants increased damage to unarmed strikes.<br /><br />This alters spirit power (lesser).<br /><br />Shared Prowess (Su): At 2nd level, a medium of the master&rsquo;s spirit endows her with greater martial expertise. She gains a dodge bonus to AC equal to her spirit bonus as long as she is wearing light or no armor.<br /><br />This replaces shared seance.<br /><br />Master&rsquo;s Strike (Su): At 6th level, when a medium of the master gains the intermediate power granted by her champion spirit, she also learns one type of <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonkUCStyleStrikes.aspx\">style strike</a>. Whenever she gains an additional attack from sudden attack, she can designate one of the blows as a style strike as long as she makes it with an unarmed strike. She can select a different style strike each time she channels a champion spirit.<br /><br />This alters spirit power (intermediate). <br /><br />Ki Contact (Su): At 15th level, as a swift action, a medium of the master can allow her spirit to gain 1 point of influence over her in order to gain a <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonkUCKiPowers.aspx\">ki power</a> and a number of ki points equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) until the spirit leaves her body.

He can&rsquo;t choose to channel a weaker spirit to reduce his influence from spirit surge. Because of his obsession with legends, he begins with 2 points of influence after a seance rather than 1.<br /><br />This ability alters spirit.<br /><br />Knowledge of Tales (Ex): A storyteller gains a +1 bonus on all Knowledge skill checks with Knowledge skills in which he&rsquo;s trained. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 medium levels that he possesses.<br /><br />This ability replaces spirit bonus.<br /><br />Versatile Surge (Su): A storyteller&rsquo;s spirit surge can be used after the storyteller fails any ability check, skill check, or saving throw.<br /><br />This ability alters spirit surge.<br /><br />Storyteller&rsquo;s Performance (Su): At 2nd level, a storyteller gains the ability to recall snippets of tales that are relevant to the current situation. This ability is similar in all respects to bardic performance as used by a bard of the storyteller&rsquo;s medium level (including interactions with feats, spells, and other abilities), and uses Perform (act), Perform (comedy), or Perform (oratory) as the storyteller&rsquo;s performance skill. However, a storyteller gains only the following types of bardic performance: inspire courage (2nd level), inspire competence (3rd level), inspire greatness (9th level), and inspire heroics (15th level).<br /><br />This ability replaces shared seance, taboo, haunt channeler, propitiation, and trance of three.<br /><br />Learn the Story (Sp): At 7th level, a storyteller becomes a master at learning a place&rsquo;s tales. He can perform for a full minute, spending 10 rounds of storyteller&rsquo;s performance, to gain the effects of retrocognition. At 10th level, he can spend 1d4 &times; 10 minutes and 10 rounds of storyteller&rsquo;s performance to gain the effects of legend lore. The subject must be at hand for the legend lore to function. At 19th level, the storyteller can spend a standard action and 1 round of storyteller&rsquo;s performance to gain the effects of vision on any subject. This ability replaces connection channel and spirit mastery.<br /><br />Living Story (Sp): At 20th level, a storyteller gains the ability to sweep others away into a story of his own making. He must perform for 1 full round, telling a tale to set the snare for his living story and spending 1 round of his storyteller&rsquo;s performance. At the end of that round, he can affect up to 30 Hit Dice of listeners within range with microcosm. Unlike with a normal microcosm, this is also a sonic and language-dependent ability, and a creature with 16 or more Hit Dice that succeeds at its save is immune to the storyteller&rsquo;s living story ability for 24 hours.<br /><br />This ability replaces astral beacon.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"ai2ntVw8D64vfC2n"}

A vessel of the failed intimately understands the shaky line between success and failure and embraces walking that line to gain power from the spirits he calls.<br /><br />Will of the Failed (Su): A vessel of the failed is intimately familiar with the supernatural stubbornness of the brash heroes who have met their demise pursuing the Test of the Starstone, and he can tap into this strength when he needs it the most.<br /><br />When a spirit attains 5 or more points of influence over the vessel of the failed, the vessel can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + half the vessel&rsquo;s class level) to avoid completely losing control to the spirit. The first time in a single 24-hour seance period that the vessel succeeds at this saving throw, he is deafened until he awakens the next day with the spirit gone. The second time the vessel succeeds at this saving throw during that period, he is also blinded. The third time, he is also staggered. These conditions are unavoidable and cannot be removed through magic or any other method. (If he wishes, the vessel of the failed can choose to forgo this saving throw and lose control to the spirit as normal.)<br /><br />The fourth time in a single seance period that a spirit gains 5 or more influence points over the vessel of the failed, the vessel must succeed at a Will save or he loses control to the spirit and effectively becomes an NPC under the GM&rsquo;s control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone.<br /><br />If a spirit ever attains 7 or more points of influence over the vessel, the vessel automatically loses control to the spirit and effectively becomes an NPC under the GM&rsquo;s control until after he awakens the next day with the spirit gone.<br /><br />A vessel of the failed cannot channel a weaker spirit.<br /><br />This alters spirit and spirit mastery.<br /><br />Reckless Surge (Su): A vessel of the failed can attempt to tap into his spirit&rsquo;s bravado&mdash;though harnessing such moxie is never guaranteed. If the vessel allows his spirit to gain 2 additional points of influence over him after failing a d20 roll that was modified by his spirit bonus, there is a 75% chance (1&ndash;75 on a d%) that he can add 3d6 to the check&rsquo;s result without taking an action. (At 10th level, these dice increase to 3d8, and at 20th level, they increase to 3d10.) However, there is a 25% chance (76&ndash;100 on a d%) that the vessel instead gains no bonus from this ability. The vessel of the failed must allow his spirit to gain the 2 points of influence over him before determining whether he receives any bonus.<br /><br />The vessel of the failed can use the spirit surge ability as normal. However, using reckless surge in the way described above always requires the vessel to allow his spirit to gain 2 additional points of influence over him, regardless of abilities that allow him to otherwise use spirit surge without incurring influence (such as taboo or spirit mastery).<br /><br />This alters spirit surge.<br /><br />Heroic Exceptions (Ex): Each time a vessel of the failed breaks a taboo he has accepted, he can allow his spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over him. When he does so, the penalty he takes on attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws changes from &ndash;2 to &ndash;1. This influence is in addition to the influence the spirit normally gains for breaking the taboo in the first place. If the vessel continues violating the taboo while taking a reduced penalty, the duration of the reduced penalty extends, but the spirit doesn&rsquo;t gain additional influence over the vessel.<br /><br />This alters taboo.<br /><br />Spiritual Swan Song (Sp): At 15th level, when the circumstances are right, the vessel of the failed can become a conduit for his spirit&rsquo;s brush with divinity. Whenever the vessel makes a successful saving throw via the will of the failed ability to avoid completely losing control to his spirit, the vessel gains one use of a spell-like ability tied to the spirit&rsquo;s legend, as noted below.<br /><br />When he gains a use of a spell-like ability, the vessel of the failed can expend it anytime before his next seance. (A vessel might gain multiple uses of these spell-like abilities, depending on how many times he successfully saves to avoid losing control to a spirit.) However, if he loses contact with a spirit during that time, he also loses all uses of the spell-like ability gained from avoiding losing control to that spirit. If the vessel does not expend his uses of these abilities, they disappear when he loses contact with that spirit or when he starts a new seance, whichever comes first.<br /><br />This replaces trance of three.<br /><br />Archmage: The vessel of the failed can cast chain lightning, freezing sphere, or sirocco as a spell-like ability. The vessel must choose which one when he gains a use of this ability. If he gains multiple uses of this ability in a single seance period, the vessel of the failed can make a different choice each time.<br /><br />Champion: The vessel of the failed can cast blade barrier as a spell-like ability.<br /><br />Guardian: The vessel of the failed can cast antimagic field as a spell-like ability.<br /><br />Hierophant: The vessel of the failed can cast mass cure moderate wounds or mass inflict moderate wounds as a spell-like ability. The vessel must choose which of these two he can use when he gains a use of this ability. If the vessel of the failed gains multiple uses of this ability in a single seance period, he can choose a difference spell-like ability each time.<br /><br />Marshal: The vessel of the failed can cast greater heroism as a spell-like ability.<br /><br />Trickster: The vessel of the failed can cast true seeing as a spell-like ability.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"dRofneCO8uueuhCA"}

Ageless and forever waiting, these beings offer immense power, but the risks are also great.<br /><br />Emissary (Su): A voice of the void channels entities called emissaries, which emulate the six legends but possess a different kind of inscrutable, alien power. They originate in a place that no mortal mind can comprehend, and their power merely passes through the astral realm to reach the medium. For each point of influence an emissary gains over a medium, the medium takes a &ndash;1 penalty on Will saves, Wisdom checks, and Wisdombased skill checks, in addition to the other penalties imposed by the emissary&rsquo;s influence. If an emissary gains enough influence to take control of him, when the medium awakens, in addition to performing the bidding of the alien entity, he retains faint memories of horrible things in dark places and takes 2d4 points of Wisdom damage.<br /><br />This ability alters spirit.<br /><br />Surge of the Void (Su): The voice of the void can use spirit surge additional times per day without incurring influence, but each time he does, he is confused for 1 round. If this confusion would cause him to babble, he can instead act normally, but his emissary gains 1 point of influence over him. The voice of the void can&rsquo;t use this ability if he is immune to confusion, but he can remove the confused condition when he is affected by it. This temporary confusion clearly indicates the voice of the void isn&rsquo;t fully in control, so if he uses this power on a Diplomacy check in a negotiation, for example, it might prejudice the other party against him regardless of his check result.<br /><br />This ability modifies spirit surge.<br /><br />Blasphemy (Ex): Emissaries demand that a medium perform acts appealing to their alien whims. These work just like taboos for an ordinary medium, but in addition to the base taboo, they require bizarre and alien acts that distance the voice of the void from his own humanity. These blasphemies cause the medium to take a &ndash;1 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks whenever he accepts a taboo. The increased devotion required to maintain a blasphemy reaps a greater reward, however. If the voice of the void is under a blasphemy, the die for his spirit surge changes from 1d6 to 1d8, increasing to 1d10 at 10th level and 1d12 at 20th level.<br /><br />This ability alters taboo.<br /><br />Void Channeler (Su): At 3rd level, the voice of the void can funnel energy from the emissaries&rsquo; realm through himself. A number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier, the medium can unleash a burst of energy that damages all other creatures except aberrations within 30 feet of him. The burst deals 1d6 points of damage + 1d6 additional points of damage for every 2 medium levels the medium has beyond 3rd. Creatures receive a Will save to halve the damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the medium&rsquo;s level + the medium&rsquo;s Charisma modifier). Creatures with fewer HD than half the medium&rsquo;s level who fail the Will save are also confused for 1d4 rounds.<br /><br />This ability replaces haunt channeler.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"gmpby6okGcjCtWoM"}

See pages 159&ndash;165 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 for more information on kami.<br /><br />Kami Channeler (Su): A kami medium channels the kami at locations different from where a normal medium channels his spirits. The kami medium channels the dosojin (which acts as the trickster) at crossroads and other major roadway milestones; the fukujin (which acts as the marshal) at ornamental shrubs and bonsai trees; the kaminari (which acts as the champion) in the midst of storms; the suijin (which acts as the hierophant) at pure lakes, ponds, springs, and wells; and the zuishin (which acts as the guardian) at significant gates, doorways, and torii. The kami medium does not have access to the archmage legend. This ability alters spirit.<br /><br />Natural Taboo (Ex): A kami medium gains the taboo ability at 1st level. Regardless of which kami he channels, each day he must accept the hierophant taboo to strongly revere nature and avoid metal armor. The kami medium gains two free uses of spirit surge from accepting this taboo, as normal. This ability alters taboo.<br /><br />Ofuda (Su): A kami medium uses ofudas&mdash;psychically charged prayer scrolls&mdash;to focus his spells. Each of his spells gains an ofuda as an additional inexpensive material component, and the ofuda replaces the divine focus for spells the kami medium gains via the divine surge spirit power. Unless the spell involves a touch attack or ranged touch attack, the kami medium doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt an attack roll to place an ofuda on an unwilling target; the ofuda simply appears on affected targets. For instantaneous spells, the ofuda is consumed during the casting, but for spells with any other duration, the ofuda remains on the target or targets throughout the duration and then disintegrates when the duration expires.<br /><br />A kami medium&rsquo;s spells can&rsquo;t be dispelled by dispel magic or greater dispel magic, but removing or destroying the ofuda ends the duration immediately. An ofuda must be displayed prominently and can&rsquo;t be hidden (though a creature bearing an ofuda can hide normally). A successful steal or grapple combat maneuver check to remove an item is sufficient to remove an ofuda from an unwilling target, and a standard action automatically removes it from a willing target. An ofuda counts as an object made of paper with 5 hit points per medium level. The target of the spell can&rsquo;t see, harm, or remove the ofuda attached to her, though her allies can do so. If the spell is harmless, the target can see her ofuda.<br /><br />This ability alters the medium&rsquo;s spellcasting.<br /><br />Shikigami (Ex): At 3rd level, a kami medium learns to fold an origami animal to serve as a temporary ward for a minor shikigami. Initially, the merged minor shikigami can&rsquo;t leave the paper body and acts in all ways as an ordinary animal familiar of the origami animal&rsquo;s type, although it still appears to be made of paper. At 5th level, it gains the abilities of a shikigami improved familiar (Bestiary 3 163), even if the kami medium doesn&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites for having a shikigami as a familiar. The shikigami treats the kami medium as its ward. Additionally, it gains the ability to use change shape to change between its full shikigami form and its origami form at will (as beast shape II).<br /><br />This ability replaces haunt channeler, location channel, and connection channel.<br /><br />Ask the Kami (Su): At 13th level, a kami medium can ask the local kami for information, as commune with nature. While he can do so any number of times per day, he can ask questions of the kami in any particular area only once per day. Afterward, he must move to a non-overlapping area to use this ability again. This ability replaces ask the spirits.<br /><br />Ward (Su): At 14th level, a kami medium can declare an area or object that&rsquo;s an appropriate place to contact his channeled kami as his ward. This grants the kami medium the ward and merge with ward abilities of the kami subtype. For large areas such as lakes or storms, a kami medium&rsquo;s ward encompasses a radius of up to 5 feet per medium level. This ability replaces astral journey.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"iJqCnPeZFLZ2B7gg"}

Unlike a normal medium, a reanimated medium becomes more powerful the more influence it has over its body. Each day, the reanimated medium can perform a seance at a location as normal to focus on one of his potential future legends. He channels that legendary potential as strongly as possible into his body. The spirit gains 3 points of influence over his body, to a maximum of 6 points. Since he is his own possessing spirit, he doesn&rsquo;t lose control at 5 or more points of influence, though he still suffers the legend&rsquo;s influence penalty as normal at 3 or more points of influence. All effects and abilities that normally increase or decrease influence (such as spirit surge and spirit powers) have the opposite effect on a reanimated medium (for instance, propitiation increases influence by 1 point and spirit surge reduces influence by 1 point); this does not apply to the new abilities from the reanimated medium archetype. A reanimated medium can&rsquo;t choose to channel a weaker spirit to avoid losing influence from using spirit surge. The body of a reanimated medium who reaches 0 points of influence enters a deathlike coma and is helpless for 24 hours, after which the reanimated medium reverts to 1 point of influence if the body is still alive, but can&rsquo;t perform a seance for another 24 hours.<br /><br />A character who selects the reanimated medium archetype after 1st level can do so only after dying; at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, a dead character of another class with an intact body who has earned enough experience points to level up can take a level in medium and gain the reanimated medium archetype, and a dead medium might be able to gain this archetype. In any case, being revived from gaining the reanimated medium archetype does not impart any negative levels or other ill effects.<br /><br />This ability alters spirit.<br /><br />Nothing Is Taboo (Ex): A reanimated medium doesn&rsquo;t gain the taboo class feature.<br /><br />Ease Passage (Su): At 3rd level, as long as a reanimated medium&rsquo;s body is intact, it&rsquo;s easy for him to return to it. He takes only 1 negative level instead of 2 from raise dead. This ability replaces haunt channeler.<br /><br />Lingering Spirit (Su): At 5th level, a reanimated medium&rsquo;s spirit lingers for up to 1 round after death before departing if the medium spends 1 point of influence. If the reanimated medium died of hit point damage, healing works on his body during the intervening round and can bring him back to life. Once the spirit departs, the breath of life spell continues to work for 1 additional round, even though the reanimated medium has been dead for more than 1 round. This ability replaces location channel.<br /><br />Spirit Warding (Su): At 7th level, the reanimated medium can ward himself from other spirits and the grave&rsquo;s call. He gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against possession, death effects, and negative energy. This stacks with the bonus to resist possession that mediums gain from having high influence. At 18th level, he becomes immune to possession, death effects, and negative energy. This ability replaces connection channel and spacious soul.<br /><br />Living Legend (Su): At 20th level, the reanimated medium reaches the legendary potential from which he borrowed so long ago and becomes a living embodiment of his legend. Any ally in the reanimated medium&rsquo;s presence can perform a seance to channel the reanimated medium (the seance takes 1 hour and is subject to the other rules for a medium&rsquo;s seance). Each ally can do this only once per day. At the end of the seance, the reanimated medium can choose to reduce his influence by 1 point. If the reanimated medium does so, some of his spirit seeps into that ally, which can then spend that 1 point of influence to use any of the reanimated medium&rsquo;s abilities that decrease influence. This ability replaces astral beacon.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"j2HETyuabMEWBvr4"}

Most rivethun spirit channelers are dwarven adherents of this ancient philosophy, but mediums of other races are accepted with equal fervor, for the rivethun teachings state that discord and heterogeneousness are the most surefire way to open one&rsquo;s senses to the spiritual world. Rivethun spirit channelers act as ambassadors and negotiators between the denizens of the natural and supernatural worlds. <br /><br />Mind and Soul (Ex): A rivethun spirit channeler chooses whether she uses her Wisdom or Charisma score to determine the effects of her medium class abilities (including this archetype&rsquo;s abilities). This includes (but is not limited to) the minimum ability score needed to learn or cast a medium spell, the save DC of her medium spells, the number of bonus spells (if any) she receives for having a high ability score, the number of times per day she can use her medium abilities, and the effects of her spirit&rsquo;s abilities. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it can&rsquo;t be changed. <br /><br />A rivethun spirit channeler knows one fewer spell of each spell level that she can cast than is indicated on Table 1&ndash;3: Medium Spells Known (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 33). <br /><br />This alters the medium&rsquo;s spellcasting. <br /><br />Spiritual Invocation (Su): Rather than channel the legend of a single spirit for 24 hours, a rivethun spirit channeler can invite a nearby local spirit into her body for 24 hours. This functions exactly like the spirit dance ability of the spirit dancer medium archetype (Occult Adventures 94), except the rivethun spirit channeler doesn&rsquo;t need to find an appropriate location to channel her spirits since she invites nearby spirits into her body instead of channeling a legend.<br /><br />This alters spirit and replaces spirit bonus and spirit surge. <br /><br />Spiritual Parley (Ex): At 2nd level, a rivethun spirit channeler adds 1/2 her medium level to Diplomacy checks attempted against fey, elementals, outsiders (except native outsiders), and undead creatures, as well as on Diplomacy checks attempted as part of the wrangle condition ability (see below). <br /><br />This ability replaces taboo. <br /><br />Wrangle Condition (Su): At 3rd level, a rivethun spirit channeler can interact directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble her or her allies. This functions like the animist shaman&rsquo;s wrangle condition ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 110). <br /><br />Haunt Channeler: A rivethun spirit channeler receives this ability at 7th level instead of at 3rd level. <br /><br />This ability replaces connection channel.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"kG8mIDoDPimQ4KbU"}
{"name":"Medium (Storm Dreamer)","permission":{"default":0,"sILyRa5lNmYbPyht":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Source <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adventurer's Guide pg. 182</a><br />Storm dreamers serve the Storm Kindlers by communing with their mystical predecessors. They serve as spiritual advisors for the organization, and are valued for the lore and wisdom they gain during their trances. During such a trance, a single storm dreamer can easily protect and defend a temple&mdash;or at the very least, provide suitably threatening defensive displays.<br /><br />Mediums who become storm dreamers select their spirits normally, but the spirits with which they bond are supernatural remnants of the first Storm Kindlers&mdash; those reckless explorers who established the tradition but succumbed to their own arrogance and were consumed by the Eye of Abendego.<br /><br />Some storm dreamers, though, become incapable of retaining their own personality and values, and transform into unpredictable forces of nature. Storm dreamers refer to this condition as being &ldquo;stormcursed&rdquo; and view these lost brothers and sisters with a mix of pity and horror. The stormcursed do not maintain ties with the Storm Kindlers, and in many cases their departure from the organization is violent and destructive. They are not viewed as heretics of Gozreh by the Storm Kindlers, but neither are they sought after as allies. They are typically treated as dangerous and unpredictable agents of the storm and allowed to dwell in relative peace in the remote locations where the stormcursed dreamers choose to dwell in. The exact cause of this condition is hotly debated among the storm dreamers themselves, for it seems to afflict their members almost randomly. Some believe these storm dreamers brushed too close to the &ldquo;slumbering mind&rdquo; of the Eye of Abendego, while others theorize that the mediums&rsquo; souls simply got pulled away and replaced with some of the half-mad fragments the dreamers speak to in trance. The truth, whatever it is, may never be fully understood.<br /><br />Gozreh&rsquo;s Domain (Su): All storm dreamers are deeply religious and select one of the domains granted by Gozreh: Air, Animal, Plant, Water, or Weather. The storm dreamer gains the 1st-level granted power from her chosen domain, but never gains the second power at higher level. When determining the effect of the granted power, the storm dreamer's effective cleric level is equal to her storm dreamer level. The 1st- through 6th-level bonus spells from this domain are added to her spell list. Despite her faith, these spells are cast normally, as psychic spells, by the medium.<br /><br />This ability replaces spirit surge.<br /><br />Storm Trance (Su): A 3rd-level storm dreamer can enter a meditative trance during which she fuses her mind to the Eye of Abendego, mentally becoming one with the great storm. Entering the trance is a full-round action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity, but once in a storm trance, the storm dreamer can maintain the trance as a free action for a number of minutes per day equal to her storm dreamer class level + her Charisma modifier. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. While in a storm trance, the storm dreamer gains energy resistance 5 against cold and electricity, treats wind as one step less severe, and gains a bonus equal to her Charisma modifier on all saving throws against wind effects, spells with the air or electricity descriptors, and effects that deal electricity damage.<br /><br />This ability replaces haunt channeler.<br /><br />Dream Storm (Sp): At 5th level, a storm dreamer&rsquo;s thoughts can cause magical weather effects to manifest. While in a storm trance, she can cast call lightning, sleet storm, and wind wall as spell-like abilities (CL = her character level). Each time she casts one of these spell-like abilities, she reduces the number of remaining minutes for her storm trance by 1 minute; she can&rsquo;t use these spell-like abilities if she has less than 1 minute remaining for the day to use her storm trance.<br /><br />This ability replaces location channel.<br /><br />Storm Seer (Su): At 7th level, a storm dreamer gains a supernatural link to the weather and can sense her surroundings more clearly. While in her storm trance, she gains blindsense 10 feet and cannot be flanked. If the weather conditions are stormy, these senses become blindsight with a range of 30 feet.<br /><br />This ability replaces connection channel.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"liFxoi5jiZeX7Y8F"}

The mediums of Shenmen face brazen yokai that hunger for the living, and these mediums have learned to devour them instead. Guardians of their communities, spirit eaters absorb the dead to channel their power and serve as a line of defense against all manner of incorporeal yokai.<br /><br />Ectoplasmic Strikes (Su): At 3rd level, a spirit eater medium treats his attacks as if they had the <a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch\">ghost touch</a> weapon property.<br /><br />This replaces haunt channeler.<br /><br />Consume Spirit (Su): At 7th level, a spirit eater can attempt to consume an incorporeal creature and house it within his body. If he reduces an incorporeal creature to 0 hit points or fewer, he can instead leave the creature at 1 hit point and consume the creature as an immediate action. A consumed creature is contained in the spirit eater&rsquo;s body and grants him a +1 bonus on either attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks, chosen by the spirit eater, and a number of temporary hit points equal to the consumed creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice.<br /><br />A spirit eater&rsquo;s body can hold a number of creatures equal to his spirit bonus. If he attempts to consume another creature after this point, he releases the creature that has been contained in his body longest. He can release a consumed creature as a free action. A consumed creature attempts to escape after 24 hours. The spirit eater can attempt to keep a consumed creature in his body by attempting a Will save (DC = 10 + half the spirit eater&rsquo;s level + twice the number of the creatures he has contained in his body). If he succeeds, the consumed creatures remain, but they grant the spirit eater&rsquo;s channeled spirit 1 point of influence over him. A released creature is destroyed as if it were reduced to 0 hit points and can reconstitute again later, if able.<br /><br />This replaces location channel and connection channel.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"sogCGDQX6NPMFUJG"}

She need not rely on locating the specific spirits that she seeks, but the relics limit the number of unique spirits she can channel.<br /><br />Relics (Su): A relic channeler begins with one relic for each of the six spirit legends. Each relic corresponds to a specific spirit, and could be any type of psychically resonant item&mdash;from a runestone with a symbol related to that spirit to a bone remnant from a legendary hero. Once a relic channeler selects a choice for taboos and spirit powers (such as archmage arcana and legendary champion), those choices remain in effect every time she channels that legend; unlike normal mediums, she can&rsquo;t select a different option each time. A relic channeler can&rsquo;t choose to channel a weaker spirit to reduce her influence from spirit surge. She doesn&rsquo;t need to find an appropriate location to channel her spirits, since she can simply use her relics. If she loses one of her relics, she is incapable of channeling that legend until she recovers the relic. If the relic is destroyed, the relic channeler can use her strong bond with the spirit of that relic to forge a new relic for that spirit from her own essence. The process takes 1 week of intense seances and 500 gp per medium level she possesses. This ability alters spirit.<br /><br />Powerful Bond (Su): Because of habitually channeling the same spirits and possessing physical links to the spirits&rsquo; former lives and legends, a relic channeler possesses a strong bond with her spirits. She receives the benefit of the Alertness feat whenever she is suffering a spirit&rsquo;s influence penalty. She chooses two spells of each level with the archmage arcana and divine surge spirit powers instead of one, two exotic weapon proficiencies with champion&rsquo;s prowess instead of one, three combat feats with legendary champion instead of two, and three skills with trickster&rsquo;s edge instead of two. This ability alters spirit.<br /><br />Object Reading (Su): At 3rd level, a relic channeler gains the occultist&rsquo;s object reading ability, substituting her medium level for her occultist level for this ability. This ability replaces haunt channeler.<br /><br />Apport Relic (Su): At 5th level, a relic channeler can call one of her relics to her once per day as though she had cast apport object on it and was mentally completing the spell. Furthermore, if the relic channeler gains the apport object spell, she can use it to receive her relics without casting it on them in advance in the same way. The range at which the relic channeler can apport her relics (both with this ability and the spell) increases by an additional 5 feet for every 2 levels she possesses beyond 5th. This ability replaces location channel.<br /><br />Connection Specialty (Sp): At 7th level, a relic channeler gains connection channel and can use that ability as a normal medium, despite not possessing location channel. She requires familiarity to use this ability, even if she is in an appropriate location. This ability alters connection channel.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Medium","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/blue_37.jpg","_id":"yY1jTW9tlu9ryev1"}
