Each day, an interrogator can create a number of injections equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the interrogator attempts to use it.<br /><br />Using an injection is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a &ndash;2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to half the interrogator&rsquo;s class level (minimum 1). If the interrogator is also using a serum with this injection, the penalty on Will saves applies to any save against the serum.<br /><br />If the melee touch attack fails, the injection isn&rsquo;t delivered but can still be used again&mdash;once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn&rsquo;t been administered becomes inert if it leaves the interrogator&rsquo;s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his possession. The penalties from multiple injections don&rsquo;t stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mesmerist\">mesmerist&rsquo;s stare</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/WitchHexes.aspx\">witch&rsquo;s evil eye hex</a>. Injections are mind-affecting poison effects.<br /><br />This ability replaces bomb.<br /><br />Serums (Su): At 1st level, an interrogator augments his ability to influence others through supplemental serums. An interrogator prepares his serums at the same time as his injections and he can apply them to any injection as a swift action before he makes the attack roll for the injection. An interrogator knows one serum at 1st level and can learn another serum in place of a discovery. The save DCs of serums are equal to 10 + 1/2 the interrogator&rsquo;s alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. A creature can be under the effect of only a single serum at a time&mdash;with the exception of memory modification serum&mdash;with any further serums on the same creature replacing the old serum. Unless otherwise noted, a creature that succeeds on its saving throw against a serum is immune to that serum&rsquo;s effects for 24 hours. An interrogator can never gain any sort of mutagen or cognatogen, even from a discovery or another class. This ability replaces mutagen and persistent mutagen.<br /><br />Charming: The injected creature must succeed at a Will save or treat the interrogator favorably, as if affected by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=charm%20person\">charm person</a>&nbsp;with a caster level equal to the interrogator&rsquo;s alchemist level. At 8th level, this serum acts as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=charm%20monster\">charm monster</a>.<br /><br />Compliance: On a failed Will save, the subject of this injection is affected by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=suggestion\">suggestion</a>&nbsp;with a caster level equal to the interrogator&rsquo;s alchemist level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level to learn this serum.<br /><br />Confusion: On a failed Will save, the injected creature is confused for 1 round per alchemist level the interrogator has. An alchemist must be at least 6th level to learn this serum.&nbsp;Hypnosis: The injected creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round per alchemist level the interrogator has.<br /><br />Memory Modification: On a failed Will save, the target of this serum is affected by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=modify%20memory\">modify memory</a>&nbsp;at a caster level equal to the interrogator&rsquo;s alchemist level. An alchemist must be at least 12th level to learn this serum.<br /><br />Paralytic: On a failed Will save, the injected creature is affected by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=hold%20person\">hold person</a>&nbsp;with a caster level equal to the interrogator&rsquo;s alchemist level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level to learn this serum.<br /><br />Truth: A creature injected with a truth serum must succeed at a Will save or be compelled to answer the interrogator&rsquo;s questions truthfully. The interrogator can ask one question per 2 alchemist levels (minimum 1). Answers might be brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the injected creature is unfriendly, but they aren&rsquo;t false. If a creature has been subjected to a truth serum within the past week, whether it succeeded at or failed its save, any new serum fails.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

She can use this ability a number of times each day equal to her alchemist level + her Intelligence modifier. An arcanotoxin functions only when used by the eldritch poisoner and becomes inert if not used within 1 minute. Creating an arcanotoxin is a standard action, and it can be applied to a weapon as a move action.<br /><br />At 1st level, an eldritch poisoner must choose whether her arcanotoxin deals Strength or Dexterity damage. At 3rd level and every 2 alchemist levels thereafter, she can enhance her arcanotoxin in one of the following ways. She can&rsquo;t select the same improvement twice in a row.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select one additional form of ability damage: Charisma, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength, or Wisdom.</li>\n<li>Grant an onset time of 1 round, or increase an existing onset time by 2 rounds (maximum 11 rounds).</li>\n<li>Increase the ability damage die by one step (maximum 1d6).</li>\n<li>Increase the number of consecutive saves required to cure the poison by 1 (maximum 3).</li>\n<li>Increase the frequency by 2 rounds (maximum 10 rounds).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If an eldritch poisoner can deal different kinds of ability damage, she selects which ability to affect each time she creates a dose of arcanotoxin, and can willingly reduce enhanced aspects of her arcanotoxin, such as the save DC or onset time. Some discoveries apply secondary effects; a dose of arcanotoxin can cause only one secondary effect.

This ability replaces Throw Anything.<br /><br />Sneak Attack (Ex): At 1st level, the eldritch poisoner gains a sneak attack identical to the rogue class feature, dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage at 1st level; the damage increases by 1d6 at 4th level and every 4 alchemist levels thereafter. This ability replaces mutagen and persistent mutagen.<br /><br />Discoveries: An eldritch poisoner can select any of the following discoveries, in addition to those available to other alchemists. Arcanotoxin discoveries with a save DC use her arcanotoxin&rsquo;s save DC.<br /><br />Antidote (Su): The eldritch poisoner can sacrifice one use of her arcanotoxin to create an extract of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=delay%20poison\">delay poison</a>&nbsp;which she can feed to an adjacent, willing creature as a standard action. Beginning at 10th level, she can instead use this ability to create an extract of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=neutralize%20poison\">neutralize poison</a>.<br /><br />Apothecary (Ex, Sp): The eldritch poisoner can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect%20poison\">detect poison</a>&nbsp;at will as a spell-like ability and gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her alchemist level on Heal checks to identify or treat poisons and to the bonus she grants when successfully treating a poison.<br /><br />Combine Toxins (Ex): An eldritch poisoner can diversify her arcanotoxin, dealing damage to any two ability scores with a single dose. The alchemist must already know how to target both ability scores with her arcanotoxin. A combined toxin reduces the damage die of its arcanotoxin by one step, to a minimum of 1 point of ability damage to each ability score.<br /><br />Contact Toxin (Su): The eldritch poisoner can create her arcanotoxin as a contact poison. A vial of contact arcanotoxin can be thrown up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack or smeared onto a surface as a standard action, but it becomes inert after 1 minute. The arcanotoxin&rsquo;s save DC is reduced by 2. The eldritch poisoner must be at least 4th level to select this discovery.<br /><br />Envenom (Su): The eldritch poisoner can create and apply her arcanotoxin to a held weapon (her own or an ally&rsquo;s) as a move action. The toxin lasts 1 minute or until used.<br /><br />Lethal Toxin (Su): The eldritch poisoner&rsquo;s arcanotoxin can deal Constitution damage. She must be at least 10th level to select this discovery.<br /><br />Mind-Altering Toxin (Su): Whenever a creature fails its saving throw against the eldritch poisoner&rsquo;s arcanotoxin, it also becomes dazzled by hallucinations for the toxin&rsquo;s duration as a secondary effect. When the alchemist reaches 10th level, targets become confused instead. The alchemist must be at least 6th level to select this discovery.<br /><br />Paralytic Toxin (Su): Whenever a creature fails its saving throw against the eldritch poisoner&rsquo;s arcanotoxin, it also becomes staggered for the toxin&rsquo;s duration as a secondary effect. Beginning at 15th level, the target becomes paralyzed instead. The poisoner must be at least 8th level to select this discovery.<br /><br />Sickening Toxin (Su): When a creature fails its save against the eldritch poisoner&rsquo;s arcanotoxin, it also becomes sickened for the toxin&rsquo;s duration as a secondary effect. When the alchemist reaches 12th level, targets become nauseated instead.<br /><br />Tailored Toxin (Ex): Choose one creature type (and subtype, for humanoids or outsiders). The eldritch poisoner&rsquo;s arcanotoxin is particularly effective against such creatures, increasing the save DC by 2. This discovery can be selected more than once; each time it applies to a different creature type (or subtype).<br /><br />Toxic Fumes (Ex): The eldritch poisoner can create her arcanotoxin as an inhaled poison. She can throw a vial of arcanotoxin up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack, affecting all creatures in a 10-foot-by-10-foot square. The arcanotoxin&rsquo;s save DC is reduced by 4, its duration is halved, and a successful save immediately ends the inhaled arcanotoxin&rsquo;s effect. The eldritch poisoner must be at least 6th level to select this discovery.<br /><br />Careful Injection (Ex): At 4th level, an eldritch poisoner can forgo some of her sneak attack damage in order to increase the save DC of a poison or arcanotoxin on the weapon used to make the sneak attack. The poison&rsquo;s DC increases by 1 for every 1d6 points of sneak attack damage forgone.

They learn methods of combining weapon attacks with their alchemical magic, and sacrifice skill with poisons in order to become more adept at using alchemical bombs or using alchemical items in conjunction with their martial skills. As an unusual side effect of their skill at handling bombs and alchemical items with increased speed, grenadiers master the ability to drink potions, elixirs, and mutagens quickly and without exposing themselves to peril while doing so. A grenadier has the following class features.<br /><br />Martial Weapon Proficiency: At 1st level, a grenadier picks one martial weapon and becomes proficient in its use. This ability replaces Brew Potion.<br /><br />Alchemical Weapon (Su): At 2nd level, a grenadier can infuse a weapon or piece of ammunition with a single harmful alchemical liquid or powder, such as alchemist&rsquo;s fire or sneezing powder, as a move action. This action consumes the alchemical item, but transfers its effect to the weapon in question. The alchemical item takes full effect on the next creature struck by the weapon, but does not splash, spread, affect additional targets, or benefit from any other effects that specifically affect splash weapons. Any extra damage added is not doubled on a critical hit. The alchemical treatment causes no harm to the weapon treated, and wears off 1 minute after being applied if no blow is struck. Infusing a new alchemical item also removes the effect of any alchemical liquid or powder previously applied with this ability. At 6th level, a grenadier can use her alchemical weapon ability as a swift action. At 15th level, this ability becomes a free action. This ability replaces poison resistance.<br /><br />Precise Bombs (Ex): At 2nd level, a grenadier gains the precise bombs alchemist discovery as a bonus discovery. This ability replaces poison use.<br /><br />Directed Blast (Su): At 6th level, a grenadier can detonate a bomb so that it splashes in a 20-foot cone rather than affecting a radius. The cone starts at the alchemist and extends away from her in the direction she chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target of the bomb and makes her attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the cone take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive directed blast, the cone of splash damage is 30 feet long instead of 20 feet. This ability replaces swift poisoning.<br /><br />Staggering Blast (Su): At 10th level, a grenadier&rsquo;s bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode. Whenever a grenadier confirms a critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC equals the bomb&rsquo;s Reflex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb&rsquo;s staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering Critical feat. Additional critical hits with bombs add to any duration remaining from previous ones. This ability replaces poison immunity.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

Since thrown weapons don&rsquo;t work well underwater, when the aquachymist creates a bomb, he either weights it or includes excess air as part of the action of creating the bomb, granting the bomb his choice of swiftly rising or swiftly sinking buoyancy and allowing him to target foes directly above or below him. If the attack misses, the bomb doesn&rsquo;t deal splash damage, but instead continues to travel up or down until it loses potency at the end of the alchemist&rsquo;s turn; the exception is when the aquachymist throws a swiftly sinking bomb close to the bottom, in which case it might reach the bottom and explode there. Because of the strange aquadynamic features of the aquachymist&rsquo;s underwater bombs, they have a range increment of only 5 feet above the water.<br /><br />This ability alters bombs.<br /><br />Amphibious Mutagen (Su): At 2nd level, an aquachymist&rsquo;s mutagen allows him to breathe both air and water for its duration, in addition to its other effects.<br /><br />This ability replaces the discovery at 2nd level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

Additionally, at 10th level she can consume a number of alcoholic beverages equal to one plus four times her Constitution modifier before becoming sickened.<br /><br />This replaces poison resistance and the discovery gained at 10th level.<br /><br />Volatile Bombs (Ex): At 2nd level, a fermenter under the influence can make her bombs more potent, but they also become unstable and more difficult to aim. As long as the fermenter is under the effects of a drug or tincture, or has imbibed an alcoholic drink in the past 10 minutes, her bombs deal 1 additional point of damage per damage die. While this ability is in effect, she also takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls made with her bombs. At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this penalty increases by 1 (to a maximum penalty of &ndash;5 at 19th level).<br /><br />This replaces poison use.<br /><br />Batch Brew (Ex): At 6th level, a fermenter learns how to brew tinctures in larger batches. Whenever she creates a tincture using Craft (alchemy), she can simultaneously create a number of additional tinctures equal to her Intelligence modifier.

Many worship Brigh and can be found throughout Golarion, especially in dwarven and gnome communities.<br /><br />Clockwork Bond (Ex): At 1st level, a tinkerer forms a bond with one of her creations, and begins play with it at no cost. This functions as the familiar option of the wizard&rsquo;s arcane bond class feature, with the tinkerer&rsquo;s effective wizard level equal to her alchemist level. If a tinkerer would gain a familiar through another class, those levels stack for purposes of determining the familiar&rsquo;s abilities.<br /><br />A tinkerer&rsquo;s familiar can take any shape the tinkerer wishes, but its statistics and abilities are identical to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Clockwork%20Spy\">clockwork spy</a>&nbsp;with the normal adjustments and abilities for a familiar applied, and it is a construct with the clockwork subtype. At 3rd level, if the tinkerer has the infusion discovery, a clockwork spy familiar can deliver the tinkerer&rsquo;s extracts with a range of touch for her. At 7th level, a clockwork spy can communicate with constructs with the clockwork subtype. Unlike most familiars, a clockwork spy does not grant special abilities to its master.<br /><br />With 1 minute of work and a successful DC 15 Heal check, a tinkerer can restore 1d4 hit points to her clockwork spy familiar. At 4th level, a tinkerer can restore 1d6 hit points to her familiar in this same way. This amount increases to an additional 1d6 hit points every 4 levels thereafter (2d6 at 8th level, 3d6 at 12th level, 4d6 at 16th level, and 5d6 at 20th level).<br /><br />This ability replaces mutagen. A tinkerer cannot choose the cognatogen or mutagen discoveries.<br /><br />Tinkering (Ex): At 2nd level, a tinkerer can spend 1 hour working on her clockwork spy familiar to enhance it with one of the options from the following list. At 5th level, the tinkerer can choose a second option from the list. The same option cannot be chosen twice.<br /><br />A tinkerer can change the enhancements applied to her familiar, but doing so takes 1 hour of work per enhancement she wishes to change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The clockwork spy familiar gains DR 2/adamantine.</li>\n<li>The clockwork spy familiar gains resist cold 5.</li>\n<li>The clockwork spy familiar gains resist fire 5.</li>\n<li>The clockwork spy&rsquo;s slam attack deals 1d3 points of damage.</li>\n<li>The clockwork spy gains a +5 alchemical bonus on Stealth checks.</li>\n<li>The clockwork spy gains darkvision 120 feet.</li>\n<li>The clockwork spy gains a +2 resistance bonus on Reflex saving throws.</li>\n<li>The clockwork spy gains a +2 resistance bonus on Will saving throws.</li>\n<li>The clockwork spy gains a +2 natural armor bonus.</li>\n<li>The clockwork familiar&rsquo;s maneuverability is average.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This ability replaces poison resistance +2, poison use, and poison resistance +4.<br /><br />Clockwork Familiar (Ex): At 6th level, the tinkerer turns her familiar into a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Clockwork%20Familiar\">clockwork familiar</a>&nbsp;that takes any form she wishes.

This requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work. A tinkerer can change the type of item her clockwork familiar carries only once every 24 hours. Additionally, a tinkerer can remove a spent item and install a new one as a move action.<br /><br />This ability replaces poison immunity.<br /><br />Clockwork Mimicries (Ex): At 14th level, a tinkerer can use her mechanical mastery to create clockwork mimicries of powerful magic items. Doing so takes 1 hour of uninterrupted work, and allows the tinkerer to create a wondrous item that functions for a number of hours per day equal to her alchemist level. When creating such a clockwork item, the tinkerer must use materials worth an amount equal to the wondrous item&rsquo;s construction cost. She need not meet any of the item&rsquo;s other creation requirements. A tinkerer cannot create a mimicry of a consumable wondrous item or a wondrous item with finite charges, and she can have only one mimicry at a time. The clockwork item never functions as a wondrous item for any other creature.<br /><br />The tinkerer can spend 1 hour disassembling a clockwork mimicry and reassembling it into a mimicry of a different wondrous item. When she disassembles a clockwork mimicry, she can salvage parts worth half of the mimicry&rsquo;s creation cost. She still must pay the full creation cost for the new mimicry.

They learn methods of combining weapon attacks with their alchemical magic, and sacrifice skill with poisons in order to become more adept at using alchemical bombs or using alchemical items in conjunction with their martial skills. As an unusual side effect of their skill at handling bombs and alchemical items with increased speed, grenadiers master the ability to drink potions, elixirs, and mutagens quickly and safely, without exposing themselves to peril while doing so. A grenadier has the following class features.<br /><br />Martial Weapon Proficiency: At 1st level, a grenadier picks one martial weapon to become proficient in the use of. This ability replaces Brew Potion.<br /><br />Alchemical Weapon (Su): At 2nd level, a grenadier can infuse a weapon or piece of ammunition with a single harmful alchemical liquid or powder, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/EquipmentMiscDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Alchemist%27s%20fire\">alchemist&rsquo;s fire</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/EquipmentMiscDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Sneezing%20powder\">sneezing powder</a>, as a move action. This action consumes the alchemical item, but transfers its effect to the weapon in question. The alchemical item takes full effect on the next creature struck by the weapon, but does not splash, spread, or otherwise affect additional targets. Any extra damage added is treated like bonus dice of damage, and is not doubled on a critical hit. The alchemical treatment causes no harm to the weapon treated, and wears off 1 minute after application if no blow is struck. At 6th level, a grenadier can use her alchemical weapon ability as a swift action. At 15th level, this ability becomes a free action. This ability replaces poison resistance.<br /><br />Precise Bombs (Ex): At 2nd level, a grenadier gains the precise bombs alchemist discovery as a bonus discovery. This ability replaces poison use.<br /><br />Directed Blast (Su): At 6th level, a grenadier can detonate a bomb so that it splashes in a 20-foot cone rather than affecting a radius. The cone starts at the alchemist and extends away from her in the direction she chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target of the bomb and makes her attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the cone take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive directed blast, the cone of splash damage is 30 feet long instead of 20 feet. This ability replaces swift poisoning.<br /><br />Staggering Blast (Su): At 10th level, a grenadier&rsquo;s bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode. Whenever a grenadier scores a successful critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equals the bomb&rsquo;s Ref lex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb&rsquo;s staggering effect, but not with the effects of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Staggering%20Critical\">Staggering Critical</a>&nbsp;feat.

Yet some assassins believe even subtler killing methods can be employed while still honoring Achaekek. These crimson chymists turn to the alchemical arts, infusing their bodies with the mutagenic essence of the Mantis God.<br /><br />Crimson Discoveries (Su): A crimson chymist gains access to several additional unique discoveries, as detailed below.<br /><br />This alters discovery.<br /><br />Arms of Achaekek: The small barbs that grow on the crimson chymist&rsquo;s arms when she drinks her mantis mutagen grow significantly in size, granting her two claw attacks as natural weapons. These claws deal damage as appropriate for her size (1d4 for Medium crimson chymists) and function as secondary attacks. These claws do not replace the chymist&rsquo;s hands, and she can still use her hands to wield weapons, attack, hold objects, and otherwise use her hands with ease, but she cannot be wearing any item in the wrists slot or any armor&mdash;if she dons magic items that occupy the wrists slot or any armor, her claws shrink back to cosmetic barbs that can&rsquo;t be used in combat as long as the armor or wrist items are worn. A crimson chymist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.<br /><br />Blood Sight: When the crimson chymist is under the effects of her mantis mutagen, her eyes transform, becoming red and multifaceted. This change grants her darkvision to a range of 60 feet and the effects of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=deathwatch\">deathwatch</a>&nbsp;for the duration of her mutagen&rsquo;s effects. If the crimson chymist already has darkvision as a benefit of her race, the range of her darkvision increases by 30 feet while using blood sight.<br /><br />Improved Arms of Achaekek: The claws granted by the arms of Achaekek discovery now function as primary weapons when the crimson chymist makes no attacks with manufactured weapons (the claws function as secondary weapons if the chymist attacks with a manufactured weapon). The damage die of the claws increases by one size category (to 1d6 for Medium crimson chymists), and attacks deal 1d4 points of bleed damage on a hit. A crimson chymist must be at least 10th level and have the arms of Achaekek discovery before selecting this discovery.<br /><br />Ingest Venom: Once per day as a standard action, the crimson chymist can ingest one dose of any poison without harming herself. The next time she imbibes her mutagen and uses her arms of Achaekek discovery, both claws are envenomed with a dose of the poison she ingested. An ingested venom remains latent in the alchemist&rsquo;s system until she activates her arms of Achaekek discovery or until 24 hours have passed, whichever comes first. Additional doses of venom ingested during that time affect the alchemist normally. A crimson chymist must have the arms of Achaekek discovery before selecting this discovery.<br /><br />Mantis Mutagen (Su): At 1st level, a crimson chymist discovers how to create a specialized mutagen that grants her aspects of a praying mantis. A mantis mutagen functions as an alchemist mutagen, save that it always enhances Dexterity and applies a penalty to Charisma. When imbibed, the mutagen causes the crimson chymist&rsquo;s flesh to grow red chitinous plates on her body as natural armor and a row of small, cosmetic barbed hooks along her arms.<br /><br />This alters mutagen.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

A saboteur has focused his alchemical research toward new ways to conceal his presence, sow confusion, and blow up large structures.<br /><br />Class Skills: A saboteur adds Knowledge (engineering) to his list of class skills and removes Knowledge (nature) from his list of class skills.<br /><br />Chameleon Mutagen (Su): At 1st level, a saboteur discovers how to create a special elixir that he can imbibe in order to heighten his ability to move undetected and his mobility at the cost of his physical might. When consumed, the elixir causes the saboteur&rsquo;s skin to change color to match the background and causes his hands and feet to secrete a sticky residue. This grants him a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to half his alchemist level (minimum +1), as well as granting him a climb speed equal to half his base speed, for 10 minutes per saboteur level. In addition, while the chameleon extract is in effect, the saboteur takes a &ndash;2 penalty to his Strength.<br /><br />This ability replaces mutagen. A saboteur who drinks an alchemist&rsquo;s mutagen is treated as a non-alchemist. All limitations to mutagens apply to chameleon mutagen as if it were the same ability. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to the chameleon mutagen.<br /><br />Saboteur Discoveries: The following new options may be taken as discoveries by a saboteur.<br /><br />Bore Bomb*: When the saboteur creates a bomb, he may choose to make it a bore bomb. If a bore bomb strikes a wall, gate, siege engine, or similar large, solid, inanimate structure, it ignores half the target&rsquo;s hardness and deals 1 point of damage per saboteur level. If a bore bomb reduces an inanimate target to half its hit points or fewer, it blows a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep in the target.<br /><br />Complex Bomb: When the saboteur creates a bomb, he can choose to have it modified by two different discoveries that modify a bomb&rsquo;s damage (those discoveries marked with an asterisk). Each discovery modifies half the bomb&rsquo;s damage dice, rounding down. For example, a concussive/frost bomb from a 9th-level saboteur deals 2d4 points of sonic damage + 2d6 points of frost damage. Creating a complex bomb counts as 2 daily uses of the bomb ability.<br /><br />Grand Chameleon Mutagen: The saboteur&rsquo;s chameleon mutagen now grants him a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to his alchemist level, as well as granting him a climb speed equal to his normal movement speed. The saboteur must possess the greater chameleon mutagen discovery and be at least 16th level to select this discovery.<br /><br />Greater Chameleon Mutagen: The saboteur&rsquo;s chameleon mutagen now also grants the saboteur the hide in plain sight ability, as the ranger ability of the same name, but it functions in any terrain. The saboteur must be at least 12th level to select this discovery.<br /><br />Grand Discoveries: A saboteur may select the following grand discovery.<br /><br />True Chameleon Mutagen: The saboteur&rsquo;s chameleon mutagen now acts as if he was under the effects of the&nbsp;greater invisibility&nbsp;and&nbsp;spider climb&nbsp;spells, using his alchemist level as the caster level, for the duration of the mutagen. The saboteur must possess the grand chameleon mutagen discovery to select this grand discovery.<br /><br />Discoveries: The following discoveries complement the saboteur archetype: acid bomb, concussive bomb, delayed bomb, explosive bomb, fast bombs, inferno bomb, madness bomb, precise bombs, smoke bomb, stink bomb ; explosive missile, immolation bomb, siege bomb; blinding bomb, cognatogen, confusion bomb, tanglefoot bomb.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

Internal alchemists develop unusual physical abilities from heightened knowledge of how their bodies work. An internal alchemist has the following class features.<br /><br />Breath Mastery: At 1st level, the internal alchemist can control his breath and the flow of vital energy within his body. Without preparation, he can hold his breath for a number of minutes equal to his Constitution score (after this, he must begin making Constitution checks or risk suffocation); by spending a full-round action preparing himself, he can increase this duration to 1 hour per point of Constitution. The alchemist can survive twice as long as normal without food or water before he starts to take penalties. He can put himself into a state of suspended animation as a move action, and is then unconscious and appears completely dead; he awakens at a preset time or in response to a condition set by him when he enters this state.

He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if he is immobilized, or if an opponent successfully uses the feint action (see Bluff) against him. If the internal alchemist already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (as a rogue) instead.

Known as toxicants, these deadly artists induce the production of deadly secretions within their own bodies in order to better inflict crippling conditions upon their foes.<br /><br />Toxic Secretion (Ex): At 1st level, a toxicant has learned to mimic creatures with the ability to secrete harmful toxins through the skin. Once per day, in a process that takes 10 minutes, the toxicant can create and imbibe a tincture that causes her skin to secrete a mild toxin. The toxicant is immune to this secretion, but any creature that hits her with a natural attack or unarmed strike must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the toxicant&rsquo;s alchemist level + the toxicant&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier). On a failed save, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the toxicant&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. At 4th level, a target that fails its save must succeed at a second save 1 round later or take the same amount of damage again. This effect repeats as long as the target continues to fail its saving throws, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 alchemist levels the toxicant possesses (to a maximum of 6 rounds at 20th level). This is a poison effect (Ultimate Magic&nbsp;138). The toxicant can suppress this secretion as a standard action, in which case it remains suppressed for 1 hour or until the toxicant reactivates it as a standard action.<br /><br />At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the toxicant can choose a condition to have her toxin impose. Once this choice is made, it can&rsquo;t be changed. A creature that fails its save against the toxic secretion also gains these conditions until it succeeds at a save against the secretion, or until the toxin&rsquo;s duration ends. At higher alchemist levels, the toxicant gains access to stronger conditions; some replace lower-level conditions, which must be selected first. The following conditions are available at the given alchemist levels: 3rd&mdash;bleed (1d6), dazzled, fatigued, or sickened; 6th&mdash;dazed or shaken; 9th&mdash;blinded (replaces dazzled) or staggered (replaces dazed); 12th&mdash;exhausted (replaces fatigued); 18th&mdash;stunned (replaces exhausted and staggered).<br /><br />As a swift action, the toxicant can collect and concentrate this secretion into a poison she can deliver as a touch attack or apply to a weapon. Targets of such attacks must attempt saving throws as if they had touched the toxicant&rsquo;s toxic secretion. The toxicant can do this a number of times per day equal to her alchemist level + her Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />This ability replaces mutagen.<br /><br />Toxic Digestion (Ex): At 14th level, a toxicant can drink a poison as a standard action and suspend it within her own body. She is not affected by the poison, and doesn&rsquo;t need to attempt saving throws against it. When the toxicant next uses her toxic secretion on a creature that attacks her with a natural or unarmed attack, she can expose the attacker to the digested poison (with that poison&rsquo;s normal duration, effects, and save DC) rather than her normal toxic secretion, even if the digested poison isn&rsquo;t normally a contact poison. The alchemist can maintain only a single digested poison at a time. If she digests a new poison, any older digested poison is lost. This ability replaces persistent mutagen.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

This special bomb remains inert until 1 round after it leaves the alchemical sapper&rsquo;s possession, after which time it becomes armed. When a creature enters a square containing an armed trip mine, it explodes, dealing normal bomb damage to all creatures in its square (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemical sapper&rsquo;s alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier; Reflex half ) and splash damage to every creature adjacent to that square. A trip mine can be disarmed with a successful Disable Device check (with a DC equal to the trip mine&rsquo;s save DC); otherwise, it lasts until the next time the alchemical sapper refreshes his daily bombs.<br /><br />If the alchemical sapper expends four uses of his bomb class feature, his trip mine deals damage as per a demolition bomb; this does not count against his daily uses of the demolition bomb ability.

A Medium alchemist can select a camel or a horse. A Small alchemist can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he&rsquo;s at least 4th level. The GM may approve other animals as mounts. This construct mount acts in most ways as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Companion\">druid animal companion</a>, using the character&rsquo;s alchemist level as his effective druid level. A construct mount is a construct, but uses the appropriate animal companion&rsquo;s statistics, gaining Hit Dice, skills, feats, and Strength and Dexterity adjustments as the alchemist advances in level. A construct mount has no Constitution score, and instead gains bonus hit points appropriate for a construct of its size. It has an Intelligence score (and skill points), a lower base attack bonus, and better saving throws than a normal construct of its Hit Dice. The mount has all the immunities of a construct (except immunity to mind-affecting effects, since it has a mind). A construct rider can use Craft (alchemy) instead of Handle Animal for all purposes involving his construct mount, though the check still takes a &ndash;5 penalty due to the construct mount&rsquo;s unusual nature.<br /><br />To create a construct with a mind and body that are constantly changing and improving, the construct rider must manufacture vast quantities of clockwork or animating reagents.

As a move action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity, the construct mount can apply the potion or extract to itself. Refilling the reservoir is a complicated process that requires a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. Failure destroys the potion or extract. The process requires 1 minute, and provokes attacks of opportunity. A construct rider must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.<br /><br />Vaporizing Reservoir (Ex, Su): The construct rider upgrades his mount&rsquo;s reservoir, adding a compartment near the mouth which stores a bomb. Loading the bomb requires the same process as loading an extract or potion. A construct mount loaded with a bomb can unleash it as a breath weapon in a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line as a standard action, dealing damage as a direct hit against all targets in the area of effect. The alchemist selects a line or cone area when loading the reservoir.

The bramble brewer takes a &ndash;2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores as long as the mutagen persists.

When coated on a weapon wielded by the ectochymist, ectoplasmic blanche lasts for a number of attacks equal to the ectochymist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 attack). This ability replaces swift poisoning.<br /><br />Ghost Trap (Su): At 8th level, an ectochymist can throw a trap to capture an incorporeal creature of up to 1 Hit Die per alchemist level he possesses. As a standard action, the ectochymist can expend a use of ectoplasmic blanche to coat the inside of a container with his blanche and throw it at an incorporeal creature as a ranged touch attack. If he hits, the creature receives a Will save to escape the trap (DC = 10 + 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier). If the creature fails its save, it is sealed within the vessel until someone breaks or opens that vessel. The ghost trap automatically survives being thrown at the incorporeal creature, but otherwise is only as durable as the vessel (normally hardness 5, 1 hp for a glass bottle).This ability replaces the 8th-level alchemist discovery.<br /><br />Ectochymical Analysis (Sp): At 10th level, an ectochymist can use alchemical processes to uncover esoteric knowledge from a haunted area that would normally require divinations to ascertain.

Because the ectochymist is performing an analysis to answer his questions and not speaking with the haunt directly, he uses Craft (alchemy) rather than Sense Motive to oppose any Bluff checks the spirit might attempt in order to mislead him.

The target is considered the imbiber, as if she had drunk an extract prepared with the infusion discovery. As the contents of an atomizer are inhaled, the target must be able to breathe. Atomized extracts are considered extracts for purposes of other abilities, and become inert when not in the alchemist&rsquo;s possession.<br /><br />This alters extracts and replaces brew potion.<br /><br />Effervescent Bombs (Su): Rather than deal direct damage, a perfumer&rsquo;s bombs create an effervescent puddle in a 5-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist&rsquo;s intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Each creature within this area takes 1d4 points of fire damage immediately and again each round it remains within or enters the puddle. A creature caught in the puddle when it is first created can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the perfumer&rsquo;s level + the perfumer&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier) for half damage. The effervescent bombs&rsquo; damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level and every odd level thereafter. Effervescent bombs otherwise functions as bombs, and discoveries that apply to bombs apply to effervescent bombs.<br /><br />This alters bomb.<br /><br />Pheromones (Su): A perfumer can spend 1 hour to distill a special mixture of exotic pheromones and alchemical reagents and store it in an atomizer. The mixture remains potent until used or until the perfumer distills another pheromone mixture, at which point the first becomes inert and the duration of its effects immediately end. Spraying this mixture on a willing creature as a standard action grants the target a +4 alchemical bonus to Charisma and a &ndash;2 penalty to Constitution for 10 minutes per alchemist level. Additionally, the target creature gains a +2 alchemical bonus on Diplomacy and Bluff checks.<br /><br />This replaces mutagen. A perfumer can never gain the mutagen, cognatogen, or inspired cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class.<br /><br />Persistent Pheromones: At 14th level, the alchemist gains the ability to distill extremely potent pheromones. His pheromone atomizers can be sprayed on up to four different targets before becoming fully used. This allows a perfumer to affect multiple targets with a single atomizer.<br /><br />This replaces persistent mutagen.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

These bombs infest their target with a virulent blight (see below). The blightseeker&rsquo;s bombs deal 1d4 points of damage (instead of 1d6), plus 1d4 points of damage for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st.<br /><br />A creature that takes a direct hit from a spore bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the blightseeker&rsquo;s level + his Intelligence modifier) or suffer the associated blight effects.

Though many overeager alchemists ultimately disappear during research expeditions, more cautious scholars of alchemy in Alkenstar are content to simply read the notes left behind by their more adventurous kindred. Some of these scholars have discovered and recorded ways to cause their bombs to create minor tears in the fabric of reality, forming extradimensional pits to vex their foes.<br /><br />Extradimensional Extract (Su): The intense study a dimensional excavator applies to dimensional forces causes him to treat his class level as 2 lower when qualifying for alchemist discoveries other than those granted by Precipitous Discoveries (see below).

On account of this distrust, many rulers often hire specialized alchemists capable of concocting protections from both poisons and diseases for the nobles and their guests. The royal alchemist tradition began in the nation of Rahadoum shortly after the Oath Wars as a replacement for the protection once offered by the clerics and priests of the region. Today, royal alchemists are found in the courts of Cheliax, Galt, Taldor, and, surprisingly, Geb, where living visitors to the Blood Lords are offered protection from the death around them.<br /><br />Class Skills: A royal alchemist adds Diplomacy and Knowledge (nobility) to his list of class skills instead of Knowledge (nature) and Survival.<br /><br />This alters the alchemist&rsquo;s class skills.<br /><br />Alchemical Antidote: At 2nd level, a royal alchemist can blend special mixes of antitoxin, medicine, and other remedies into alchemical antidotes that can be imbibed by anyone. The royal alchemist creates his alchemical antidotes when he prepares his extracts for the day; they remain potent for 1 day before losing their properties, and the cost of the materials used to make them is insignificant. An alchemical antidote does not qualify as an extract or an infusion for the purpose of feats or discoveries.<br /><br />The royal alchemist has a pool of points equal to 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence bonus that he can divide among any number of alchemical antidotes, though the maximum number of points he can spend on a single antidote is equal to 1/2 his alchemist level (minimum 1). Each point grants the imbiber of the alchemical antidote a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws against poison for a number of hours equal to the royal alchemist&rsquo;s Intelligence bonus (minimum 1).<br /><br />The royal alchemist can also create an antidote that protects against diseases. For every 2 points the royal alchemist spends from his pool, the imbiber of the alchemical antidote gains a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws against disease for 24 hours. The royal alchemist can expend 10 points from his pool to provide immunity to diseases or poisons (decided by him at the time of the antidote&rsquo;s creation); this immunity lasts for a number of minutes equal to the royal alchemist&rsquo;s Intelligence bonus (minimum 1) after the antidote is imbibed. An alchemical remedy can protect against either diseases or poisons, but not both.<br /><br />At 6th level, the royal alchemist can alter the distribution of the bonuses of any unused alchemical antidotes as a full-round action, either combining them or splitting the bonuses further. The royal alchemist must be holding all unused alchemical antidotes he wishes to alter in this way.<br /><br />This ability replaces the alchemist&rsquo;s poison use and swift poisoning.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

A plague bringer feels no more remorse at unleashing his armaments on his enemies than an archer does when firing an arrow in the heat of battle. Disease is a tool, and the plague bringer is its master. A plague bringer has the following class features.<br /><br />Plague Vial (Su): At 1st level, a plague bringer can create a plague vial, an alchemically grown and concentrated disease sample. It takes 1 hour to prepare a plague vial, and once prepared, the vial remains potent until used. A plague bringer can only maintain 1 plague vial at a time&mdash;if he prepares a second vial, any existing plague vial becomes inert. A plague vial that is not in a plague bringer&rsquo;s possession becomes inert until a plague bringer picks it up again.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s a standard action to drink a plague vial. Upon being imbibed, the plague vial infects the plague bringer&rsquo;s blood, sweat, tears, and other bodily fluids for 10 minutes per class level. Any creature that harms him with melee attacks (except with reach weapons) must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the plague bringer&rsquo;s level + the plague bringer&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier) or become sickened for 1 round per plague bringer level. The plague bringer is immune to the effect of his own plague vial, but not that of another&rsquo;s plague vial. The effects of multiple plague vials do not stack.<br /><br />As a standard action, the plague bringer can infect a weapon with this sickness (typically by licking it or wiping his blood or pus on it). The disease on the weapon works like a poisoned weapon, except the source is a disease instead of a poison (so a dwarf&rsquo;s resistance to poison does not apply).<br /><br />Anyone other than a plague bringer (including another alchemist) who drinks a plague vial must make a saving throw against the vial&rsquo;s DC or become nauseated for 1 hour. Unless he learns how to brew a mutagen by taking the mutagen discovery , he can never benefit from a mutagen and reacts to it as if he were a non-alchemist. At any particular time, a plague bringer can only be under the effect of either a plague vial or a mutagen (not both); drinking another immediately ends the effects of any ongoing plague vial or mutagen.<br /><br />All limitations to mutagens apply to plague vials as if they were the same substance. The infuse mutagen discovery and persistent mutagen class ability apply to plague vials. The sticky poison discovery applies to a weapon infected with a plague vial. The plague vial is a disease effect. This ability replaces mutagen.<br /><br />Disease Resistance (Ex): At 2nd level, a plague bringer gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, a plague bringer becomes completely immune to disease (including magical diseases).

For example, he automatically adds&nbsp;summon nature&rsquo;s ally I&nbsp;to his formula book at 1st level and adds the next higher-level spell to his formula book each time he gains the ability to use extracts of that level. The horticulturist uses these special extracts to plant a seed that grows into a creature, bypassing the restriction for single target or personal effects. Using these extracts takes 1 round (as the spell&rsquo;s normal casting time), and the creature summoned must be placed in a space adjacent to the horticulturist. The horticulturist can use these extracts to summon only animals and plants on the appropriate&nbsp;summon nature&rsquo;s ally&nbsp;list. Creatures the horticulturist summons with these extracts become creatures with the plant type (gaining low-light vision and immunity to mind-affecting, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning effects) rather than their normal type, but their attack bonuses, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills don&rsquo;t change.<br /><br />This replaces the mutagen class feature and the discovery normally gained at 2nd level. A horticulturist can&rsquo;t choose mutagen discoveries.<br /><br />Herbal Bombs (Su): A horticulturist&rsquo;s bombs lack the power of a traditional alchemist&rsquo;s but can be fine-tuned in ways normal alchemist explosives cannot. The horticulturist&rsquo;s bombs deal 1d4 points of damage (instead of 1d6), plus 1d4 points of damage for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st. When the horticulturist creates a bomb, he can formulate it to affect plants and other creatures normally, affect only plant creatures, or affect only creatures not of the plant type.<br /><br />This alters the bomb class feature.<br /><br />Plant Voice (Ex, Su): At 2nd level, a horticulturist gains further knowledge about plants, and he eventually learns to speak with them. He gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks, and at 10th level, he can speak to plants as a constant&nbsp;speak with plants&nbsp;spell (this ability is supernatural).<br /><br />This replaces poison resistance, poison use, and poison immunity.<br /><br />Plant Familiar (Ex): At 4th level, a horticulturist creates a Diminutive or Tiny alchemical plant creature that vaguely resembles a kind of animal suitable for a familiar (such as a cat) and acts as his familiar, granting the horticulturist a skill bonus, the Alertness feat, and so on. The plant familiar has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a bat-like plant familiar can fly) but is treated as a creature of the plant type and has familiar abilities based on the horticulturist&rsquo;s alchemist level (though some familiar abilities may be useless to the horticulturist). An alchemist&rsquo;s extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells or deliver touch spells. If a plant familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level the horticulturist has. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.<br /><br />This replaces the discovery gained at 4th level.<br /><br />Fury of Nature (Sp): At 14th level, a horticulturist&rsquo;s connection with nature allows him to bring down nature&rsquo;s fury on his opponents.

Energists are more likely than most alchemists to follow strange traditions and to travel the planes, discussing theories with jyoti, sceaduinars, and undead alike. Energists are often found in lands with unusual variations between life and death, such as Geb, or Virlych in Ustalav.<br /><br />The energist is an unusual archetype in that all who choose this specialized path must select one of two types of energy to focus on&mdash;positive energy or negative energy. The mechanics of how this archetype alters the basic alchemist class abilities function the same regardless of this choice, but these two schools of thought are diametrically opposed in every way. Just as positive energy and negative energy react violently when mixing together, energists of opposing themes traditionally interact violently. Although most who choose positive energy tend to be of good alignment and those who focus on negative energy gravitate toward evil, there is no underlying ethical or moral restriction for an energist to adhere to. Positive energy can be used for evil purposes, and negative energy to pursue good goals. But even then, energists whose alignments and philosophies otherwise would seem to match find themselves at odds if their chosen energies oppose the other.<br /><br />To energists, the curious and frustrating nature of their oppositional energy is a constant thorn in the side of their intellects&mdash; an ever-present reminder that by choosing to specialize in one, they have forsaken potential discoveries in the other.<br /><br />Energy Focus: An energist chooses whether to pursue the path of positive energy or the path of negative energy. Once selected, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. If he chooses negative energy, he adds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=harm\">harm</a>&nbsp;as a 6th-level formula and the inflict spells to his alchemist formulae list and removes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=heal\">heal</a>&nbsp;and the cure spells.<br /><br />This alters extracts.<br /><br />Energist Bombs (Su): An energist&rsquo;s bombs deal damage based on the energy he chose at 1st level. If he chose positive energy, his bombs damage undead creatures, dealing an amount of positive energy damage equal to his normal bomb damage. If he chose negative energy, his bombs damage the living, dealing 1d4 points of negative energy damage plus 1d4 additional points at every odd-numbered alchemist level beyond 1st (instead of 1d6). He can&rsquo;t apply discoveries with an asterisk (*) to his bombs. When an energist reaches 10th level, undead damaged by his positive energy bombs must succeed at a Will save or flee for 1 round as if affected by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Turn%20Undead\">Turn Undead</a>&nbsp;feat, while living creatures damaged by an energist&rsquo;s negative energy bombs must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. An energist&rsquo;s bombs don&rsquo;t heal creatures normally healed by the energist&rsquo;s chosen energy type.<br /><br />This alters bombs and replaces poison immunity.<br /><br />Healing Ampoule (Su): At 2nd level, as a standard action, an energist can create and throw a healing ampoule of the same energy type as his bombs up to 30 feet, using two of his daily uses of bombs. A living creature subject to a direct hit by a healing ampoule of positive energy regains 1d4 hit points plus an additional 1d4 hit points for every even-numbered alchemist level an energist has beyond 2nd, while a direct hit by a negative energy healing ampoule instead restores an equivalent number of hit points to an undead target. In either case, the energist adds his Intelligence modifier to the number of hit points healed, as if the ampoule were a splash weapon benefiting from his throw anything ability. A healing ampoule has no splash effect on adjacent targets unless it misses the target; if it misses, determine where it lands as if it were a splash weapon. Healing ampoules don&rsquo;t damage creatures normally damaged by the energist&rsquo;s chosen energy type.<br /><br />This alters throw anything and replaces the discovery gained at 2nd level and swift poisoning.<br /><br />Energist Resistance (Su): At 2nd level, an energist gains energy resistance equal to his alchemist level to positive or negative energy, whichever would naturally harm him. When on a positive-dominant plane such as the Positive Energy Plane, he can apply this resistance to offset the plane&rsquo;s fast healing.

A creature damaged by an ooze bomb takes additional acid damage equal to the oozemaster&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier at the start of the oozemaster&rsquo;s next turn. A creature can take this delayed damage only once per round; additional hits extend the duration of the ongoing damage by 1 round each.<br /><br />An oozemaster cannot select discoveries that change the type of damage dealt by his bombs, nor those that affect the bomb&rsquo;s splash radius.<br /><br />This ability otherwise functions as and replaces the bomb class feature.<br /><br />Ooze Toxin (Ex): An oozemaster can extract deadly toxins from the bodies of slain oozes and use them against his foes, making him a deadly opponent with unpredictable stratagems. As a full-round action while adjacent to an ooze that died within the past 10 minutes, an oozemaster can attempt a Craft (alchemy) check with a DC equal to 10 + the ooze&rsquo;s Challenge Rating to create a toxin. If successful, the oozemaster can extract a number of doses of toxin from an ooze equal to half its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). These toxins remain potent for 1 hour before becoming inert.<br /><br />The oozemaster can throw an ooze toxin as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, or he can apply the toxin to a weapon as if it were an injury poison.

Concocters seem reckless to those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with their ways, but those who know them understand that these alchemists simply have unorthodox methods.<br /><br />Mutagenic Mixology (Ex): At 2nd level, whenever a concocter brews a potion, he can mix in some of the chemicals he uses to create his mutagen, adding some of his mutagen&rsquo;s effects to this concoction.<br /><br />When he drinks this concoction, he gains the benefit of the potion as normal. Additionally, he gains a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to one of his physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), while suffering a &ndash;2 penalty to the corresponding mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), just as though the concoction were a mutagen. The ability score that receives the bonus must be chosen when the concoction is made. These benefits and penalties last for the duration of the effects of the potion on which the concoction is based or for 1 minute per the concocter&rsquo;s alchemist level, whichever is shorter.<br /><br />The effects of this concoction do not stack with another such concoction or a mutagen. If the concocter drinks another concoction or a mutagen while under the effects of this concoction, the effects of any previous concoction or mutagen immediately end. A concoction that is not in the concocter&rsquo;s possession becomes inert until the concocter picks it up again (even if the concocter has the infuse mutagen discovery). The process used to combine the mutagen with a potion make it particularly volatile, so anyone else who drinks the concoction (including other alchemists) does not gain its benefits and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 minute. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + the concocter&rsquo;s alchemist level + the concocter&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />Additional reagents and materials are required to brew a concoction in this way, doubling the cost in raw materials to create the potion on which the concoction is based. A mutagen brewed into a concoction in this way does not count against the number of mutagens the concocter can have active at a given time.<br /><br />A concocter can make one such concoction per day at 2nd level and a second per day at 4th level. A concoction becomes inert 24 hours after it is created.<br /><br />This replaces the discoveries gained at 2nd and 4th levels.<br /><br />Extracting Mixology (Ex): At 6th level, a concocter can combine an extract and a potion, allowing him to consume this mixture simultaneously, albeit with some potential side effects. As a full-round action, the concocter can combine an extract with a potion in his possession. The concocter can then drink the mixture as a standard action. If he does not consume the mixture within 2 rounds of creating it, the mixture grows inert and both the extract and the potion are ruined. This ability cannot be used with a potion into which he has fused his mutagen using his mutagenic mixology ability.<br /><br />The exact effects of drinking one of these mixtures are volatile and unpredictable. Each time the concocter drinks a mixture, roll on the following table to determine the result.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>d4</td>\n<td>Effect</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Either the extract (01&ndash;50 on a d%) or potion (51&ndash;100 on a d%) has no effect. The consumable that takes effect treats its caster level or the concocter&rsquo;s alchemist level as 2 higher, whichever is appropriate.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Both the extract and potion function normally.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Both the extract and potion function normally but treat their caster level or the concocter&rsquo;s alchemist level as 2 higher, whichever is appropriate.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Both the extract and potion function normally and are affected as though they were spells extended with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Extend%20Spell\">Extend Spell</a>&nbsp;metamagic feat.

A nonevil blood alchemist can&rsquo;t use the lifeblood ability, but he can use his other archetype and class abilities, and he can continue to advance in alchemist.<br /><br />Lifeblood (Su): When a blood alchemist performs a coup de grace that kills an intelligent humanoid creature (though, not a summoned intelligent humanoid creature), he can gather its lifeblood into a vial; this is a death effect. He can use this lifeblood any time within the next 24 hours to create an extract of a spell level he can cast that is no higher than 1/2 the creature&rsquo;s CR, without spending a daily extract slot. He can use this ability once for each spell level each day (for example, a 13th-level blood alchemist can use lifeblood to gain additional 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th level extracts). A blood alchemist can&rsquo;t take the mutagen or cognatogen discoveries.<br /><br />This ability replaces mutagen.<br /><br />Alchemical Circles (Sp, Su): A blood alchemist gains a blood pool with a number of points equal to his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier. He can spend 1 point from his blood pool to draw a complex alchemical circle in blood on the ground or on another permanent fixture in a process that takes 1 minute. Depending on his alchemist level, the alchemical circle can have one of several effects. At 1st level, the blood alchemist can spend an unused extract slot to charge the circle with alchemical energy. He chooses one of the spells listed on page 45 of equal or lower level to the extract slot he spent, and until he refreshes his extract slots, as long as his body is in physical contact with the circle, he can produce the effect of the spell he chose as a spell-like ability. If the spell normally has an expensive material component, he must still provide it, either grinding it up and mixing it with the blood used for the circle or placing it in the circle (if the component is also the target). The chosen effect can target or affect only something contained within the circle, or the surface on which the blood alchemist drew the circle. To learn one of these effects, he must write it into his formula book, with the same cost as usual for a formula (he can also use his free formula from leveling up to learn the chosen effect instead of a normal formula).

A trap breaker can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. This ability replaces poison use and poison resistance +2.<br /><br />Explosive Disarm (Ex): At 5th level, a trap breaker can attempt to disarm a mechanical trap by detonating it rather than disarming it with a Disable Device check. As a fullround action, a trap breaker may expend one of his bombs to make a ranged touch attack against a trap, using the trap&rsquo;s Disable Device DC as its AC. If the attack misses, the bomb&rsquo;s splash damage activates the trap. If the attack hits, the bomb deactivates the trap without setting it off. The trap breaker must both know the location of the trap and be able to reach the trap&rsquo;s trigger with a ranged touch attack in order to use this ability. At 8th level, a trap breaker can disarm magic traps with this ability. This ability replaces poison resistance +4 and poison resistance +6.<br /><br />Land Mine (Ex): At 6th level, a trap breaker can turn his bombs into land mines. Setting a land mine is a fullround action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The land mine fills a single 5-foot square, and can&rsquo;t be placed in the same space as another trap, land mine, or magic trap. The trap breaker can arm the land mine with any bomb he is eligible to use, and the effects of this bomb are immediately transferred to the land mine. Creating a land mine uses up two of the alchemist&rsquo;s bombs per day. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the land mine, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid its effects are equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist&rsquo;s level + his Intelligence modifier. All alchemist land mines are mechanical traps with the qualities&nbsp;Trigger: location and&nbsp;Reset: none. Land mines last for 1 day per alchemist level or until they are triggered, whichever comes first. This ability replaces swift poisoning.<br /><br />Mine Engineering (Ex): At 10th level, a trap breaker&rsquo;s expertise in improving explosives allows him to create land mines with minimal expense.

A chirurgeon has the following class features.<br /><br />Infused Curative: At 2nd level, a chirurgeon&rsquo;s extracts of cure spells automatically act as infusions, and can be used by non-alchemists. When a chirurgeon prepares his extracts, he may choose to render any or all of his infused curatives inert and prepare other extracts to replace them (unlike infusions, which continue to occupy the alchemist&rsquo;s daily extract slots until consumed or used). This ability replaces poison use.<br /><br />Anaesthetic: At 5th level, a chirurgeon learns how to supplement uses of the Heal skill with pain-killing drugs. He gains Skill Focus (Heal) as a bonus feat. Any use of the Heal skill that has a risk of harming the patient (such as extracting a barb) only deals the minimum damage when performed by a chirurgeon. This ability replaces poison resistance +4.<br /><br />Power Over Death: At 10th level, a chirurgeon adds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=breath%20of%20life\">breath of life</a>&nbsp;to his formula book as a 4th-level extract.

He can attempt Profession (herbalist) checks in place of Craft (alchemy) checks for all purposes, and he gains a competence bonus equal to half his alchemist level on Profession (herbalist) checks to create alchemical items and to forage for and process herbs (see page 152). An herbalist uses his Wisdom score instead of his Intelligence score for all alchemist class abilities.<br /><br />This alters alchemy and the alchemist&rsquo;s key ability score.<br /><br />Natural Magic: An herbalist&rsquo;s study of the leshy spirit grants him access to natural magic that eludes other alchemists. Each time he gains access to a new level of extracts (including 1st level), he can add two spells from that spell level on the druid spell list to his alchemist class spell list; these spells must target a creature or creatures or have a range of &ldquo;you,&rdquo; and he must still add them to his formula book as normal before he can prepare them. As always, the extracts affect the drinker as if she were the target, so offensive touch spells are a nasty trap for the drinker.<br /><br />This replaces Throw Anything.<br /><br />Seedpods (Su): An herbalist can produce and throw seedpods as ranged touch attacks, similar to the ranged attacks of other leshys. He can create a number of seedpods each day equal to his alchemist level + his Wisdom modifier and can throw them as a standard action with a range increment of 20 feet. A seedpod deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter (this additional damage isn&rsquo;t multiplied on a critical hit or from effects like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vital%20Strike\">Vital Strike</a>). Seedpods are considered weapons and can be selected for feats like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus\">Weapon Focus</a>, and the herbalist can take the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Extra%20Bombs\">Extra Bombs</a>&nbsp;feat to gain additional daily uses of his seedpods. His seedpods also gain one of the following additional effects unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the herbalist&rsquo;s alchemist level + his Wisdom modifier). At 1st level, his seedpods can deafen their target for 1 round like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Leaf%20Leshy\">leaf leshy</a>. At 2nd level, they can reduce the target&rsquo;s vision to 10 feet for 1 minute (unless the target spends a full-round action to wash the spores from its eyes early) like the spores of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fungus%20Leshy\">fungus leshy</a>. At 5th level, they can entangle their target for 2d4 rounds (unless the target succeeds at a Strength check or Escape Artist check at the save DC to break the vine early) like the seeds of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Gourd%20Leshy\">gourd leshy</a>.

Though the powerful potions they brew can have drawbacks, they are at least pleasurable.<br /><br />Alcoholic Alchemy (Su): A mixologist can infuse potions and extracts he creates with alcohol, increasing their potency. When a mixologist brews a potion, he can spend an additional 10 gp in raw materials to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of the potion&rsquo;s effects, but the potion counts as a strong alcoholic drink (see the sidebar on page 55). When a mixologist creates his extracts, he can spend 1 extra minute doing so to increase his caster level by 1 for the purpose of that extract&rsquo;s effects, but the extract counts as a strong alcoholic drink. A mixologist can prepare one alcoholic extract for each level of extracts he can prepare. A mixologist can&rsquo;t ever gain a mutagen or discoveries that alter mutagens.<br /><br />This alters alchemy and brew potion and replaces mutagen.<br /><br />Alcoholic Bombs (Su): When the mixologist creates a bomb, he can cause the detonation to produce intoxicating fumes. A creature that takes a direct hit from an alcoholic bomb becomes tipsy (see page 54) if it fails a Fortitude saving throw. If the creature is already tipsy, it becomes drunk instead. If the creature is already drunk, it becomes soused instead. A soused creature that fails its Fortitude saving throw passes out for 1d3 hours and wakes up with a hangover. This ability counts as a discovery that modifies bombs, so it doesn&rsquo;t stack with other discoveries that modify bombs.<br /><br />This replaces the discovery gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Alcoholic Resistance (Ex): At 2nd level, a mixologist&rsquo;s bonus on saving throws against poison also applies on saving throws to become less drunk and to avoid passing out. This doesn&rsquo;t allow a mixologist to become immune to alcohol.<br /><br />This alters poison resistance.<br /><br />Mixologist Master (Su): At 14th level, a mixologist can have up to two alcoholic extracts for each level of extracts he can prepare as long as he can prepare at least two extracts of that level.<br /><br />This replaces persistent mutagen.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

When loading a firearm, he can infuse the ammunition as a free action. The compounds are unstable, and if not fired within a number of rounds equal to the gun chemist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier (though no sooner than the end of his next turn), the alchemical ordnance becomes inert and loses its additional effects; he can still fire the firearm as normal. Each day, the gun chemist can infuse a number of pieces of alchemical ordnance equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier, and he can fire no more than one piece per round.<br /><br />Alchemical ordnance deals damage as normal, plus an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 + the gun chemist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. The damage of the gun chemist&rsquo;s alchemical ordnance increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered class level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vital%20Strike\">Vital Strike</a>). The explosive nature of alchemical ordnance causes the attack&mdash; both the firearm&rsquo;s base damage and the alchemical ordnance&rsquo;s additional damage&mdash;to deal full damage to swarms of any size. If the gun chemist uses alchemical ordnance to make a scattering shot with a weapon with the scatter quality, each creature in the area instead takes additional fire damage equal to the alchemical ordnance&rsquo;s minimum damage (so if the alchemical ordnance would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage normally, it deals only 6 points of fire damage with a scattering shot).<br /><br />The gun chemist&rsquo;s alchemical ordnance functions safely only in weapons he wields. If anyone but a gun chemist attempts to fire a firearm loaded with alchemical ordnance that is not yet inert, the firearm&rsquo;s misfire value increases by 4. If the firearm would explode as the result of such a misfire, the explosion deals additional fire damage equal to that of the alchemical ordnance.<br /><br />Alchemical ordnance is treated like an alchemist&rsquo;s bomb for the purpose of discoveries, though such discoveries ignore any effects associated with a bomb&rsquo;s splash damage or radius unless the gun chemist also applies the exploding bullet discovery. A scattering shot modified by a discovery applies additional effects as though affected creatures were caught in the splash damage of a bomb rather than subject to a direct hit. The DCs of saving throws associated with alchemical ordnance are equal to 10 + half the gun chemist&rsquo;s alchemist level + the gun chemist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />This replaces bombs.<br /><br />Gunsmith: A gun chemist gains a battered gun identical to the one gained by a 1st level&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Gunslinger\">gunslinger</a>, as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Gunsmithing\">Gunsmithing</a>&nbsp;feat (including the ability to restore his battered gun as if he were a gunslinger). As a standard action, the gun chemist can expend one use of his alchemical ordnance to remove the broken condition from a single firearm he is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained from a misfire.<br /><br />This replaces Brew Potion and Throw Anything.<br /><br />Discoveries: A gun chemist selects alchemist discoveries as normal. He can also select from the discoveries below, which are unique to the gun chemist. Discoveries marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack, including with other alchemist discoveries marked by an asterisk that modify bombs. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual alchemical ordnance.<br /><br />Chemical Stability: When firing an alchemical ordnance, the gun chemist reduces the misfire value of the firearm by 1 (minimum 0) and ignores any increased misfire value from using an alchemical cartridge.<br /><br />Exploding Bullet*: The gun chemist&rsquo;s alchemical ordnance splashes adjacent targets as though it were a splash weapon, dealing the alchemical ordnance&rsquo;s minimum additional damage to other creatures caught in the splash (Reflex half). A gun chemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.<br /><br />Fast Ordnance: A gun chemist with this discovery can fire more than one piece of alchemical ordnance as part of a full attack. A gun chemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.<br /><br />Cartridge Savant (Ex): At 2nd level, a gun chemist can make optimal and highly efficient use of alchemical cartridges, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Alchemical%20cartridge%20(flare)\">flare cartridges</a>. If the gun chemist fires such an alchemical cartridge and it allows a saving throw to negate or reduce the cartridge&rsquo;s effect, the saving throw&rsquo;s DC increases by 1 (to a maximum DC of 22). The DC increases by an additional 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 7 higher at 20th level). When a gun chemist fires an alchemical cartridge that deals a type of damage in place of a firearm&rsquo;s normal damage (such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Alchemical%20cartridge%20(dragon%27s%20breath)\">dragon&rsquo;s breath cartridge</a>), he can increase the damage dealt by an amount equal to his Intelligence modifier.<br /><br />This replaces poison resistance.<br /><br />Repeat Fire (Ex): At 6th level, a gun chemist gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rapid%20Reload\">Rapid Reload</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat and must select a type of firearm. If he already has this feat, he can instead gain one combat feat for which he qualifies.<br /><br />This replaces swift poisoning.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

They thought she was finished. They were wrong.<br /><br />Mad Genius (Su): At 2nd level, a mad scientist can deal 1d3 points of Wisdom damage to herself (or 1d6 points of sanity damage if employing the sanity rules found on page 12) to create a genius extract as one of her daily 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, or 5th-level extracts. This otherwise takes the same amount of time and effort as creating a normal extract of its level, but instead of her choosing a formula she knows for it to grant, a genius extract has an unpredictable result. When the alchemist (or an ally, if she has the infusion discovery) drinks the extract, it produces a random effect from the list of alchemist formulae on page 32 of the&nbsp;Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide&nbsp;of 1 spell level higher than the extract&rsquo;s spell level. For instance, if she creates a genius extract using a 2nd-level extract, it would produce the effect of a random 3rd-level alchemist formula. There is no way to predict which effect a genius extract will produce before drinking it. A genius extract&rsquo;s minimum caster level is equal to the minimum caster level of the extract used, not the effect produced. So, for instance, a genius extract that produced a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=fox%E2%80%99s%20cunning\">fox&rsquo;s cunning</a>&nbsp;effect would have a minimum caster level of 1 (for the 1st-level extract used) rather than 4 (for the 2nd-level effect). There are 29 potential 2nd-level extracts, 23 potential 3rd-level extracts, 18 potential 4th-level extracts, 15 potential 5th-level extracts, and 15 potential 6th-level extracts.<br /><br />This ability alters alchemy and replaces the discovery gained at 2nd level.<br /><br />Mad Mutagen (Su): At 4th level, a mad scientist can brew a mad mutagen in place of a normal mutagen. If she does so, she need not make any decisions about the mutagen (including whether to make it a cognatogen or another variant mutagen if she has the appropriate discoveries) when she brews it. When the mad scientist drinks her mad mutagen, she makes those decisions on the fly, but she also takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage if using the sanity rules on page 12). If anyone else, even another alchemist, drinks a mad mutagen, that person must succeed at a Will save (with the same DC as for the Fortitude save against nausea) or she becomes confused for 1 hour.<br /><br />This ability alters the alchemist&rsquo;s mutagen and replaces the discovery gained at 4th level.<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>Alchemist Formulae from the&nbsp;Advanced Player's

Fire bombers only add their Intelligence bonus to damage from bombs or alchemical substances that deal fire damage. This otherwise works like the alchemist&rsquo;s bomb and throw anything abilities.

For example, an 8th-level fire bomber could throw a concussive bomb that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 3d4 points of sonic damage. Additional effects from the bomb still apply, but the save DC for admixture bombs is reduced by 2. This replaces the alchemist&rsquo;s 4th-level discovery.<br /><br />Fire Body (Ex): At 8th level, a fire bomber adds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=elemental%20body%20I\">elemental body I</a>&nbsp;to his extract list as a 3rd-level extract.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Elemental%20body%20I\">Elemental body</a>&nbsp;extracts prepared using fire body are limited to fire elementals only.

Furthermore, while under the effects of this mutagen, whenever the alchemist takes damage, his rage grows, with detrimental effects. At the end of each turn that he takes hit point damage, the ragechemist must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15, or DC 20 if any of the damage came from a critical hit that turn) or take a &ndash;2 penalty on Will saving throws and to Intelligence.

When such alchemists are preparing defenses against larger creatures that might enter their tunnels and attempt to exterminate them, their skills mean the difference between life and death.<br /><br />Bomb Trap (Su): At 2nd level, an alchemical trapper can use one of her bombs to make a trap. Setting a bomb trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A bomb trap fills a single 5-foot square and cannot be placed in the same area as any other trap. The alchemical trapper needs the same materials required for making a bomb. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to the DC for the alchemical trapper&rsquo;s bombs. All bomb traps have location triggers and do not reset. The alchemical trapper can use any one discovery that applies to a bomb when making a bomb trap. The bomb trap lasts 10 minutes for each alchemist level the trapper possesses. If the bomb trap is not disabled or exploded within that time frame, the trap becomes inert.

Today, the ectoplasm master is not automatically regarded as an agent of sinister evil as a result.<br /><br />Ectoplasmic Extracts (Su)&nbsp;: Instead of using alchemical reagents in order to create alchemical items (including his bombs, extracts, and mutagens), an ectoplasm master uses reagents such as corpse dust, crystallized ectoplasm, and similar reagents as alchemical catalysts. Just as with standard alchemists, the costs of these materials are insignificant and are comparable to the costs of the valueless material components of most spells. As a result of his eccentric techniques and use of odd alchemical components, an ectoplasm master has an expanded formula list. He adds all sorcerer/wizard spells of 6th level or lower from the necromancy school to his alchemist formula list (but must still learn each of these spells normally). If a spell appears on both the alchemist formula list and the sorcerer/wizard spell list, the ectoplasm master uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell.<br /><br />This ability alters extracts and replaces Brew Potion.<br /><br />Ectoplasm Master Discoveries (Su)&nbsp;: An ectoplasm master is able to select the following alchemist discoveries, in addition to general discoveries.<br /><br />Ectoplasmic Mutagen: Whenever the ectoplasm master imbibes a mutagen, his living flesh transmutes into ectoplasm, causing him to take on a semiliquid form. He no longer gains a natural armor bonus from his mutagen, but instead becomes immune to critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attacks) while under the mutagen&rsquo;s effects. An ectoplasm master must be at least 6th level to learn this discovery.<br /><br />Ectoplasmic Servant: An ectoplasm master who selects this discovery adds all summon monster spells of 6th level or lower to his alchemist formula list as ectoplasmic extracts. Whenever he summons a creature using an ectoplasmic extract, the creature must appear in a square adjacent to his own, and it gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ectoplasmic%20Human\">ectoplasmic creature template</a>. Creatures summoned using ectoplasmic extracts cannot have templates other than the ectoplasmic creature template.<br /><br />Siphon Bomb: The ectoplasm master&rsquo;s bombs can be modified to neutralize and crystallize the ectoplasmic energy of haunts and incorporeal undead. A siphon bomb deals full damage to incorporeal creatures as if it were a force effect, but deals only nonlethal damage to corporeal creatures. A siphon bomb also damages haunts, provided the siphon bomb explodes within a haunt&rsquo;s area of effect.

A mindchemist has the following class features.<br /><br />Cognatogen: At 1st level, a mindchemist learns how to create a cognatogen, as per the cognatogen discovery. This ability replaces the mutagen class ability (a mindchemist cannot create mutagens unless he selects mutagen* as a discovery).<br /><br />Perfect Recall: At 2nd level, a mindchemist has honed his memory.

A sacrament alchemist is often invaluable even to like-minded allies who are not adherents of the alchemist&rsquo;s religion but who nonetheless rely on his divine abilities.<br /><br />Faithful: Like a cleric, a sacrament alchemist must worship a deity, and must be within one step of his deity&rsquo;s alignment.<br /><br />Sacramental Cognatogen (Su): A sacrament alchemist can anoint himself as his deity&rsquo;s servant using his own special version of a mutagen called a sacramental cognatogen. This is brewed, imbibed, maintained, and can nauseate non-alchemists in the same way as a mutagen. While a sacramental cognatogen is in effect, the sacrament alchemist takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Dexterity.<br /><br />Instead of providing physical benefits, the sacramental cognatogen grants the sacrament alchemist access to the domain powers of one domain or subdomain belonging to his deity as if he were a cleric of his alchemist level. The sacrament alchemist must choose the domain or subdomain when he brews the sacramental cognatogen. A sacrament alchemist can select an alignment domain only if his alignment matches that domain. He treats his alchemist level as his cleric level for purposes of using these domain powers, and treats his Intelligence modifier as his Wisdom modifier for purposes of variable effects. The effects of the sacramental cognatogen last for 10 minutes per alchemist level.<br /><br />A sacrament alchemist doesn&rsquo;t gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does he gain any bonus spell slots. Levels of classes that normally provide access to domains stack with the sacrament alchemist&rsquo;s alchemist level for purposes of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for purposes of determining bonus spells. Discoveries, feats, and effects that interact with the mutagen class feature do not affect sacramental cognatogen. A sacrament alchemist cannot take the cognatogen or mutagen discoveries.<br /><br />This ability replaces mutagen.<br /><br />Divinely Inspired Alchemy (Su): At 3rd level, a sacrament alchemist&rsquo;s faith inspires him with ideas for novel alchemical achievements, although the mental strain means that he can&rsquo;t reliably repeat them.

Aerochemists use scraps of Shory&rsquo;s magic in their concoctions to gain personal powers of flight.<br /><br />Aeromantic Concoction (Su): An aerochemist learns to craft a special alchemical concoction. It takes 10 minutes to brew a dose of this concoction, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An aerochemist can maintain only 1 dose of this concoction at a time&mdash;if he brews a second dose, any existing concoction becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, an aeromantic concoction that is not in the aerochemist&rsquo;s possession becomes inert until he picks it up again. Anyone other than the aerochemist who attempts to drink his aeromantic concoction is affected in the same fashion as is a non-alchemist who drinks an alchemist&rsquo;s mutagen.<br /><br />When consumed, an aerochemist&rsquo;s aeromantic concoction makes his body become incredibly buoyant for 10 minutes per alchemist level. The concoction grants the aerochemist a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks to attempt high jumps or long jumps, and he is always treated as having a running start when attempting long jumps. In addition, the aerochemist gains the benefits of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=feather%20fall\">feather fall</a>&nbsp;for the concoction&rsquo;s duration. At 6th level, the aerochemist gains the benefits of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=fly\">fly</a>&nbsp;for the concoction&rsquo;s duration. At 10th level, the aerochemist can choose to gain the benefits of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=air%20walk\">air walk</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=fly\">fly</a>&nbsp;for the concoction&rsquo;s duration. At 14th level, the duration of the concoction increases to 1 hour per alchemist level.<br /><br />An aerochemist with the infusion discovery can instead create a shared alchemical concoction intended for his allies. This shared concoction grants the same benefits as the normal aeromantic concoction, except the duration is only 1 minute per alchemist level its creator has. At 14th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per alchemist level. An aerochemist can have only a standard concoction or shared concoction in effect, not both.<br /><br />This replaces mutagen, swift poisoning, and persistent mutagen. An aeromantic alchemist can never gain the mutagen, cognatogen, or inspired cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class.<br /><br />Bombs Away (Ex): At 2nd level, an aerochemist becomes an expert at attacking from above. He gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls made with thrown weapons against targets that are at least 10 feet below him. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level, and increases by an additional 1 every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum bonus of +5 at 18th level.<br /><br />This replaces poison use and swift alchemy.<br /><br />Aerodynamic Prowess (Su): At 2nd level, an aerochemist gains a +2 bonus on Fly checks.

This ability replaces Brew Potion and Throw Anything.<br /><br />Homunculus Companion (Ex): At 1st level, a promethean alchemist gains the service of a homunculus companion. The means for creating this special homunculus are more exotic than normal and require investiture of the promethean alchemist&rsquo;s own life essence into the homunculus. This construct generally resembles a small humanoid or child when first created; the specific appearance is up to its creator, though a homunculus is always humanoid in shape and obviously unnatural on close inspection. While every homunculus companion is absolutely devoted to its master, some homunculi&rsquo;s loyalty borders on the unsettling; such companions jealously protect their masters from threats or construct strange shrines in their masters&rsquo; honor. A homunculus companion can be of any alignment, even one that is different from its master&rsquo;s. A destroyed homunculus companion can be restored to life by performing a ritual with its corpse that requires 1 pint of its creator&rsquo;s blood per Hit Die of the homunculus and rare materials worth 100 gp per Hit Die of the homunculus. Performing this ritual takes 1 hour (though it may take some time to gather enough blood at higher levels, so many promethean alchemists keep chilled blood samples in storage just in case). A promethean alchemist can&rsquo;t take the mutagen or cognatogen discoveries. This ability replaces bombs and mutagen.<br /><br />Discoveries: The following discoveries complement this archetype: alchemical simulacrum, doppelganger simulacrum, and greater alchemical simulacrum.</p>\n<h2>Homunculus Companion Base Statistics</h2>\n<p>A homunculus companion has the following features, as described on Table 2-2 on page 114.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Level</td>\n<td>HD</td>\n<td>BAB</td>\n<td>Saves</td>\n<td>Skills</td>\n<td>Feats</td>\n<td>Str/Dex Bonus</td>\n<td>Special</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>Darkvision, low-light vision, sympathetic alchemy, telepathic link, weapon and armor proficiency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>Evasion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>Ability score increase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>Speech</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+7</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Spell resistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>Ability score increase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+9</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+9</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+11</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>Ability score increase, improved evasion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+12</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+13</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+14</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>Ability score increase</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />Level: This is the homunculus&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s alchemist level.<br /><br />HD: This is the homunculus&rsquo;s total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice.

They are often involved in expeditions into dangerous tombs and catacombs, where their ability to create alchemical devices designed to neutralize constructs and undead are often crucial to survival. A crypt breaker has the following class features.<br /><br />Alkahest Bombs (Su): A crypt breaker&rsquo;s bombs are specially designed to work best against constructs and corporeal undead-two foes commonly encountered in ancient tombs. Known as alkahest bombs, these bombs deal acid damage instead of fire damage. Alkahest is an alchemical fluid that eats away unliving flesh and animated constructs, but it doesn&rsquo;t work as well against other targets. Against constructs and corporeal undead, alkahest bombs deal 1d8 points of damage, plus 1d8 points of damage for every odd-numbered level instead of 1d6. Against all other creatures, alkahest bombs deal 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces the standard alchemist bomb class feature.<br /><br />Crypt Breaker&rsquo;s Draught (Su): Rather than develop mutagens that increase their natural armor and physical abilities at the expense of their minds, crypt breakers focus on the creation of special draughts that can enhance their senses. When a crypt breaker drinks one of these draughts, he gains a +4 bonus on all Perception checks and gains one of the following special senses: darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, or scent. While under the effects of a crypt breaker&rsquo;s draught, the alchemist also gains light blindness. This ability replaces the mutagen class ability (a crypt breaker cannot create mutagens unless he selects the mutagen discovery).<br /><br />Trapfinding: A crypt breaker adds 1/2 his level on Perception checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A crypt breaker can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. When determining the ability of a crypt breaker to deal with locks or traps, treat his alchemist levels as rogue levels. This ability replaces the Brew Potion bonus feat.<br /><br />Discoveries: A crypt breaker may take the following rogue talents as discoveries: quick disable, trap sense, and trap spotter. Treat the crypt breaker&rsquo;s alchemist level as his rogue level for these talents.<br /><br />Enhanced Alkahest (Su): At 14th level, a crypt breaker&rsquo;s alkahest grows more potent. Against constructs and corporeal undead, the crypt breaker&rsquo;s alkahest bombs deal +1 points of damage per die, and the bomb threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. This does not stack with other effects that improve critical hit threat ranges. This ability replaces persistent mutagen.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}

A mnemostiller still uses his Intelligence score to learn new formulae.<br /><br />The mnemostiller can cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect%20thoughts\">detect thoughts</a>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />This alters alchemy and replaces throw anything.<br /><br />Rasugen (Su): A mnemostiller learns to brew a unique type of mutagen, called a rasugen, that suppresses his mind to enter a state of sublime purity. In this state, a mnemostiller becomes incredibly resilient, but cannot perform complex skills. Once imbibed, a rasugen grants a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving throws and 2 temporary hit points per alchemist level for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the rasugen is in effect, a mnemostiller takes a &ndash;2 penalty to his Intelligence score and can&rsquo;t attempt checks using Appraise, Craft, Disable Device, Heal, Knowledge (any), Profession, Sleight of Hand, or Spellcraft. This acts in all other ways like a mutagen.<br /><br />This replaces mutagen. A mnemostiller can never gain the mutagen, cognatogen, or inspiring cognatogen ability, even from a discovery or another class.<br /><br />Anguish Bomb (Su): A mnemostiller crafts his bombs from mnemos of pain and discomfort, inflicting psychic damage. An anguish bomb is identical to a bomb except that it deals nonlethal damage, it deals no damage to inanimate objects and creatures immune to mental effects, and creatures caught in the anguish bomb&rsquo;s splash can attempt a Will save for half damage. A mnemostiller uses his Charisma score in place of his Intelligence score to determine the bonus damage of his anguish bomb and the save DC of the anguish bomb&rsquo;s splash damage. He still uses his Intelligence score to determine his number of bombs per day. If the mnemostiller has taken any hit point damage in the past 24 hours, his anguish bombs inflict 1 additional point of nonlethal damage for every 2 alchemist levels he has.<br /><br />This replaces bombs.<br /><br />Brewed Memories: A mnemostiller can create several unique extracts from the mnemos he pulls from the minds of others. At 2nd level, he adds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=mindlink\">mindlink</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=placebo%20effect\">placebo effect</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=thought%20echo\">thought echo</a>&nbsp;to his formula book as 1st-level extracts. At 5th level, he adds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=aura%20alteration\">aura alteration</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect%20mindscape\">detect mindscape</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=mindscape%20door\">mindscape door</a>&nbsp;to his formula book as 2nd-level extracts. At 8th level, he adds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=mindwipe\">mindwipe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=thoughtsense\">thoughtsense</a>&nbsp;to his formula book as 3rd-level extracts; the range for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=mindwipe\">mindwipe</a>&nbsp;extract becomes creature touched, and it can be applied only to a helpless or willing creature.<br /><br />This replaces poison resistance.<br /><br />Natural Empath (Ex): A mnemostiller&rsquo;s studies naturally focus on others. He gains infusion as a bonus discovery at 2nd level.<br /><br />This replaces poison use.<br /><br />Mind-Delver (Su): At 10th level, a mnemostiller can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=mind%20probe\">mind probe</a>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>\n<h2>Mnemostil</h2>\n<p>First developed to help heal souls who had experienced undeath for a time, the art of mnemostil involves a practitioner carefully extracting or returning memories as an oily vapor&mdash;mnemos&mdash;which allows tortured souls to confront their past horrors one at a time while finding closure. In a city largely dedicated to waiting out eternity and cultivating absent passion, however, there are abundant souls eager to feel anything, good or bad. Black-market mnemostillers pay handsomely to extract memories from remarkable souls, even traveling to other planes to build up their stock before returning to Spire&rsquo;s Edge to sell their wares. While there is some crossover with information brokers, mnemostillers typically sell experiences and emotions rather than secrets. Petitioners searching for purpose buy what memories they can to try and shape themselves toward one Outer Plane destination or another, often trading in their genuine memories as payment, until little of the original individual remains. Some criminal syndicates target visiting souls and outsiders to extract their memories by force.<br /><br />Mnemostil has also created a unique faith in Spire&rsquo;s Edge: amnesia cults. Many petitioners succumb to the expectation that they grow&mdash;that who they were in life is somehow not enough&mdash;and so render themselves into temporary or permanent blank slates to dwell in inert bliss. Others cannot reconcile their own actions and so wipe themselves clean to live in ignorance.<br /><br />Pruning the development of the soul is anathema to the purpose of Spire&rsquo;s Edge, and the city&rsquo;s psychopomps aggressively hunt both mnemostillers and amnesia cultists, with punishment for the crime invariably being exile into the Astral Plane.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"Alchemist","useCustomTag":true,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":0,"hd":0,"hp":0,"bab":"","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":""},"ref":{"value":""},"will":{"value":""}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":0},"skill":{"value":0},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":false,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":false,"fly":false,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":false,"kdu":false,"ken":false,"kge":false,"khi":false,"klo":false,"kna":false,"kno":false,"kpl":false,"kre":false,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":false,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":false,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/grand-yellow.jpg"}
